                &lt;br&gt;Imagine a future where you walk into a store, pick out the items you want to buy, put them in your shopping cart, and then just walk out of the store when you are done – no billing counters queues and no checkouts. This can be made possible by an array of technology innovations such as sensors, beacons, IoT devices, and a lot of innovative software. Interestingly, the future is already here, at least in some places – Amazon Go and Alibaba are already offering this experience. Let’s go back a little bit. The first wave of digital commerce began with digital and mobile wallets such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, which allowed users to make payments using a mobile phone or a device. But the user has to initiate the transaction and complete a couple of steps. The second wave started when Uber introduced invisible payments to its...&lt;br/&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 18:46:00 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>AMEinfo: 2018 Travel Report finds 110% increase in mobile bookings in GCC -  Puntaje: 4800</title><link>https://ameinfo.com/travel/2018-travel-report-gcc/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="150" height="150" src="https://ameinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock_1036867843-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" srcset="https://ameinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock_1036867843-150x150.jpg 150w, https://ameinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock_1036867843-200x200.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;With the high smartphone penetration rates and large young population, the GCC region continued to experience strong growth in mobile transactions in 2018, according to the 2018 Travel Insights Report jointly released this week by Cleartrip and Flyin. The market recorded a 110% increase in mobile bookings as they represented one-third of all transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Travel Insights Report provides a comprehensive overview of the online travel sector in the GCC, as well as highlights significant shifts in the market dynamics and consumer behaviour. The market saw variations in average airfares as well as travellers’ preferences in destinations, trip duration, and payment methods. Key findings of the report covering the January-December period include the sustained expansion of the industry, the rising trend of mobile traffic in major cities, and the growing popularity of travel coupons among travellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sameer Bagul, Executive Vice President &amp;amp; Managing Director, Cleartrip Middle East, said: “We are excited to launch the fourth edition of the Travel Insights Report on the region’s online travel sector. Offering an exclusive and deeper understanding of the underlying trends in the market and consumer behaviour, our report has established itself as one of the most respected and trusted sources for insights into the industry. The actionable data we provide will help travellers to plan and book their trips efficiently and enable businesses to develop solutions that cater to the evolving needs and expectations of customers. We will continue to explore new ways to further enhance our comprehensive survey and look forward to releasing our H1 2019 Travel Insights Report.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With advancements in mobile technology making travel more accessible to the region’s growing population, the online travel industry is headed for a new phase of growth. As reflected in our study, travellers’ preferences are constantly changing, and therefore, it has become imperative for online travel agents to make investments into newer technologies such as machine learning and utilizing blockchain capabilities to drive bespoke personalization and superior user experience. When we launched our mobile Progressive Web App (PWA) in 2018 our conversion rates increased by 67% as we continue to help consumers seamlessly make their travel bookings,” Mr. Bagul added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing payment method preferences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though credit card still remains the dominant payment method in the online travel market, debit card transactions are on the rise. In the Kingdom, which has seen a spike in the adoption and usage of debit card after its central bank, Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA), enabled the country’s mada cardholders for online shopping last year, travel bookings using debit cards surged 280% year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to account for 45% of all bookings. In the UAE credit card transactions dipped to 72% from 81% in the previous year and debit cards usage increased from 19% to 28%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing mobile penetration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to the rising popularity of digital wallets and mobile apps, mobile transactions are quickly gaining traction among travellers. In Saudi Arabia, which had the highest rate of Mobile Booking Penetration (MBP) in the region, mobile bookings accounted for 38% with a massive rise of 233% from the previous year. Meanwhile, the number of transactions made on mobile devices increased by 56% in the UAE, whereas Oman recorded the second highest MBP in the region at 34%. Among mobile bookings in the Kingdom iOS share was higher at 71% compared to Android devices share of 29%. The company expects this number to grow in 2019 as ApplePay™ was launched in Saudi Arabia earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile has become a popular channel for travel planning and booking in major cities in the region. Kuwait City and Riyadh had the highest rates of mobile traffic and bookings at 81% and 40% respectively. Bahrain, Muscat and Dubai were also among the leading markets for mobile visitors in the 2018 Travel Insights Report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trending destinations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting their growing appetite for novel experiences, the region’s discerning travellers made trips to a wide variety of destinations within the GCC and overseas. Islamabad, Lahore and Brussels topped the list of trending international destinations for travellers in the UAE, while domestic travellers in Saudi Arabia favoured Gizan, Abha and Ha’il. Meanwhile, Istanbul remained among the leading family travel destinations during both summer and winter seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airfares in a flux&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As crude oil prices continued to fluctuate in 2018, the region’s leading markets saw significant changes in airfare pricing. Average ticket prices were 10% and 6% higher in Bahrain and Kuwait respectively, while Saudi Arabia experienced an overall price decline of 7% due to growth of low-cost carriers such as flyadeal. As some of the large airlines reduced capacity from Kuwait, it recorded the highest average fare per person at $281, while Oman had the lowest in the region at $192.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some routes originating from the region have seen fluctuations in airfares last year. While Jeddah-Dubai recorded the highest increase at 25%, the Jeddah-Cairo route witnessed the greatest decline in airfares at 19%. In addition, micro-trips have taken off as a new trend in the region’s travel industry. Ha’il and Kuwait appeared to be the cheapest getaways from Riyadh and Dubai respectively last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also indicates that Sunday is the cheapest day for travel, whereas prices increase on Thursday. Furthermore, February is the ideal month for budget travellers with average fares falling 16%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustained market growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With lower airfares, increased connectivity and fewer travel barriers, the GCC continues to witness an increase in the number of travellers. In 2018, the industry posted a robust Y-o-Y growth of 7%, while Saudi Arabia emerged as the fastest growing market with a solid 10% expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The impact of disruptive technologies on the tourism industry is set to create multi-billion dollar savings through the use of IoT, robotics, artificial intelligence (A.I), Virtual Reality (VR) and wearable technology according to data published ahead of Arabian Travel Market (ATM) 2019, which takes place at Dubai World Trade Centre from April 28 to May 1, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest research from Colliers International, in partnership with ATM 2019, reveals that in addition to vast cost savings, the customer experience is set to be more streamlined with travel set to become better, smoother and more personalized with travel bookings on VR platforms, AI chatbots guiding customers through the booking process and IOT providing internet-based inter-connectivity between everyday devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Technology and the use of technology is evolving every day. The tourism industry is at the very forefront of tech innovation with companies investing huge sums of money to improve the customer journey and experience. Airports and airlines accounted for $30 billion of investment in IT in 2018, however, this will be offset by the implementation of technology that will see fuel savings alone top $30 billion in the next 15 years," said Danielle Curtis, Exhibition Director ME, Arabian Travel Market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATM 2019 has adopted cutting-edge technology and innovation as its main theme and this will be integrated across all show verticals and activities, including focused seminar sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen incredible developments in recent years, SITA, the multinational tech company to the air transport industry for example, is using robots to check travelers onto flights and to transport their luggage, while, although in the infancy stage, robots have been used in some hotels to welcome guests and show them to their room,” Danielle Curtis added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;AI is already superior to man. In Driverless cars, it is sure to avoid accidents. In medicine, it can diagnose, treat and discover therapies at record speeds. It compiles and analyses data at seemingly breakneck speeds, yet accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We live in a hyper-connected world. By 2022, we are going to see more traffic crossing global networks than in the entire history of the Internet combined. This traffic comes from all of us, and increasingly, our machines,” said David Meads, vice president, Middle East and Africa, Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_1381538" align="alignnone" width="1024"] Technology adoption is so much faster and AI is its newest face[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligent machines will one day be able to learn, create and adapt to any situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not there yet and we’re just taking baby steps with AI, and perhaps that’s wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless we are careful, the machine will think it can take over. As humans are naturally inefficient, AI will automatically try to make us redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in many ways, it is already doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI: The threats &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report by Deloitte estimated that in the next twenty years low paid, unskilled and repetitive jobs are five times more likely to be taken over by AI algorithms than high skilled, well paid jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Petter, EMEA VP, Pure Storage told AMEinfo: “Just about anywhere we currently use humans to complete repetitive tasks, AI can help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts predict that robots will do 30% of our jobs by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subrat Panda, Principal Architect and Head of AI at Capillary Technologies told AMEinfo: “AI is currently most useful and productive in the supervised mode where labelled data is abundant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AI does the heavy lifting but the solutioning logic is very domain specific and needs the additional human defined layers. Jobs that require a lot of context, emotional quotient, and societal interactions will require a lot of human intervention and involvement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, many AI experts believe AI intelligence to surpass that of humans, and more interesting is if they develop self-consciousness and feelings of love and suffering. Most human mistakes are made when actions are emotionally motivated. Will AI make them worse if cyber guilt is not part of the emotional portfolio?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The late Stephen Hawkings said: “Success in creating Artificial Intelligence would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI: The opportunities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petter said AI is something we are already seeing across several industry verticals. With the help of Pure Storage and NVIDIA, Global Response has begun development on a state-of-the-art call centre system that will allow for a superior and customized customer experience and faster solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthcare, Paige.AI is an organization focused on revolutionizing clinical diagnosis and treatment in oncology through the use of AI. It aims to transform the pathology and diagnostics industry from highly qualitative to a more rigorous, quantitative discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“UC Berkeley’s AMPLab created and pioneered real-time analytics engine Apache Spark™, the fastest, most cutting-edge analysis tool in the world. The UC Berkeley genomics department then implemented Apache Spark on top of flash storage to serve as an accelerator to make major leaps in genomic sequencing,” added Petter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Man AHL, a pioneer in the field of systematic quantitative investing, also leverages Apache Spark on top of flash storage to create and execute computer models that make investment decisions. “Roughly 50 quantitative researchers and more than 60 technologists collaborate to formulate, develop and drive new investment models and strategies that can be executed by computer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI: The need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avaya Holdings Corp. today announced that it will be opening a Customer Experience Center (CEC) at One Central, Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC), where it will showcase the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), biometrics, and blockchain-enabled communications and collaboration solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the recent Avaya SuperServe report, nearly half (48%) of consumers would like organizations to use AI to improve their products and services, and 71% would like to use voice analytics or biometrics as a means of secure authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petter quoted a survey conducted by MIT Technology Review and commissioned by Pure Storage that said 85% of respondents in MEA believe that there will always be a need for humans to interpret the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This creates a whole new demand for what the industry now calls ‘data scientists’. In addition, AI will free up workers to think more creatively about the business challenges they face and reduce rote tasks so workers can turn their focus to innovation and become more creative on strategic projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI: The Benefits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umair Mohammed, founder of Wigzo told Expresscomputer.in that considering the plethora of communication channels available to people, AI allows businesses to create an omnichannel experience to engage customers continuously, consistently and instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pepper, the first humanoid robot, is a fine example of customer engagement. It is used by SoftBank Mobile and Nestle stores in Japan, to adapt to customer’s tastes and habits,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers also expect personalized experiences and Google, for example, by watching what you search and what you click on, it learns what you like, love or hate and throws personalized notifications by using relevancy and self-learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for making predictions, “You may have perhaps heard of ‘Digital Genius’, an automated chat software which combines Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to form responses based on historical chat data of the customers”, Mohammed said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; AI: the infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the region taking advantage of AI capabilities or doing what is needed for public/pvt sectors to make the leap?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, there is a boost from the government on the AI strategy in all verticals, specifically energy, transportation, Environment, education, technology etc. In my opinion, there is a long way to go for proper AI adoption but there is simple and productive usage of AI which is plugging holes everywhere,” said Panda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petter said the primary barriers to AI adoption are infrastructure readiness, a big challenge, and sparse talent resources (data scientists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till recently enterprises were stuck with building their own solution for AI. With “Do-it-yourself” (DIY) these enterprises lose months of productivity trying to leverage the existing, complex DIY platforms and go through the painful cycle of integrating, testing and continuously maintaining both the hardware and ever-evolving software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Enterprises need solutions that are proven, tested and mature so that they can focus on how the technology helps their business problem rather than worrying about building the underlying technology themselves,” Petter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when all of this is done, users often find that workloads are slow. It’s because the system is built with old, legacy components cobbled together in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it is paramount that organizations invest in all-flash data platforms. Flash storage arrays are best suited for these AI projects as they encompass parallelism that mimics the human brain and enables multiple queries or jobs to run simultaneously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
