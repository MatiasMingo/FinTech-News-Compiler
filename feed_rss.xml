A dapp, portmanteau of “decentralized app,” is any app that runs on decentralized infrastructure, like on Ethereum. For your coding pleasure, our team is happy to present Muttniks, a friendly Ethereum space doggo “kernel” (or kennel) that you can build from the comfort of your spacecraft. Muttniks is an open source sample dapp, built to guide you through our exciting journey with Astro Ledger. Like the real stars and planets featured on &lt;a href="https://www.astroledger.org"&gt;astroledger.org&lt;/a&gt;, you can securely adopt, name, and trade Ethereum space doggos with Muttniks (and then donate your testnet ETH to build more &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika"&gt;Laika&lt;/a&gt; monuments). The following is a step-by-step technical exploration of the inner workings of Astro Ledger, which you can recreate on your local machine with Muttniks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muttniks was the “pet” project of Astro Ledger CWM (Chief Wow Muttniks) &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlazenka"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks Tony!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/385/1*FhP6UIAHAAjcceXIdkCjjQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This star’s Henry Draper catalog number is HD137052. &lt;a href="https://www.astroledger.org/#/card?externalId=137052&amp;amp;category=1"&gt;It has been named ‘Tlon&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keeping Track of Stars &amp;amp; Muttniks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to assign names to actual stars, we needed a way to uniquely identify them. For this we used the Henry Draper Catalog of the brightest stars in the sky, with meta-information provided by the &lt;a href="http://www.astronexus.com/hyg"&gt;HYG database&lt;/a&gt; from The Astronomy Nexus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our specially selected Muttniks have no such prior catalog so we pseudo-randomly assigned each Muttnik a number, 1–6. The meta-information about each Muttnik (name and image) is loaded into the database in this &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlazenka/muttniks/blob/develop/modules/flyway/src/main/resources/db/migration/V3__pets_1.sql"&gt;Flyway migrations file&lt;/a&gt;. Our Astro Ledger creative content (spearheaded by Chief Chocolate Dehydrator &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@a.howitt"&gt;Aleeza&lt;/a&gt;) and image links are similarly loaded into the database, with SQL code created by offline Python scripts that load data from HYG and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a Muttnik is added to a database, we use a &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlazenka/muttniks/blob/develop/sol/migrations/3_muttniks_1.js"&gt;Truffle migration script&lt;/a&gt; to add the same Muttnik to the contract, putting it up for adoption. For Astro Ledger stars, those same offline Python scripts create corresponding Truffle migration scripts to create stars and put them up for space-grant-supporting-auctions at the price of about a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contract &amp;amp; Events: Creating and Adopting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Muttniks are stored in a &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlazenka/muttniks/blob/3f981a7191f7b313aaea77e2156416d2c2e19446/sol/contracts/Adoption.sol#L12"&gt;“pets” mapping&lt;/a&gt; where each pet has an address variable for the adopter, initialized to address(0), and a boolean variable exists to distinguish this pet from one that hasn’t been created yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The function createAdoptee is used by the &lt;em&gt;Muttnik Kernel&lt;/em&gt; owners to create each Muttnik in the contract. This is typically done in batch with a &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlazenka/muttniks/blob/develop/sol/migrations/3_muttniks_1.js"&gt;Truffle migration script&lt;/a&gt;, but could be called by any function. Adoption happens via the adopt function, which checks to see that the Muttnik hasn’t already been adopted before assigning the Muttnik’s address to the adopter. Adoption events are emitted so the browser can inform the astronaut/cosmonaut of the adoption when the blockchain confirms it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contract &amp;amp; Events: Naming Muttniks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious solution to handling Muttnik (and star) names was to store the name as a variable in the contract. To find the name, folks could call a view function (for zero gas) that would return the name. However, storing data in an Ethereum contract is never a cheap operation. Because Astro Ledger’s goal is to allow anyone to be able to assign meaningful names to stars, we implemented the assignName function using &lt;em&gt;events&lt;/em&gt; instead. Names are forever stored on the blockchain as 32 bytes of data on a log of the event, but because they aren’t accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the gas cost to assign a name is almost negligible. This philosophically-motivated decision allowed us the exhilarating discovery that much of the existing software for Ethereum does not fully support event-logs, but we went to the edges of the universe to achieve a solution for pulling up the names quickly, as described later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/909/1*E-hICbgh-y3hecBDtfH9fQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The owner of &lt;a href="https://www.astroledger.org/#/card?externalId=162004&amp;amp;category=1"&gt;HD162004&lt;/a&gt; is well aware that changing a star’s name is not to be taken lightly…&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Web Stack&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Chief Rubber Taster &lt;a href="http://jonathan.lansey.net/"&gt;Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; worked on the contract and the star database, Tony began building the Astro Ledger web stack using Play! for a web framework (&lt;a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/play/play-framework-async-io-without-thread-pool-and-callback-hell"&gt;ol’ reliable&lt;/a&gt;), and Postgres for the database (ol’ &lt;a href="http://renesd.blogspot.com/2017/02/is-postgresql-good-enough.html"&gt;good enough for everything&lt;/a&gt;). At first, Tony chose &lt;a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.7.x/ScalaTemplates"&gt;Twirl&lt;/a&gt; to generate HTML pages of available stars. He quickly learned that the majority of the anticipated Astro Ledger user base had settled on a browser plugin called MetaMask to talk to Ethereum blockchains, and so began sneaking in some JavaScript (including a popular library called &lt;a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API"&gt;web3js&lt;/a&gt;) into the webpages to support this. The code to generate web pages soon became a funny mix of Scala, HTML, and ES5, where all of the blockchain interactions were executed using web3js. This worked, and was fast enough in our test environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it’s probably still fair to call the main Ethereum network itself a “test environment,” deploying our app to it in our first production alpha revealed one that was far slower than even Tony’s 2014 Macbook Air. This was particularly true for the for-loops we used in our contract to search for a user’s star cards, which were executed individually in the user’s web browser whenever they went to our page (note that, to guard against this performance hit, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlazenka/muttniks/blob/develop/sol/contracts/Adoption.sol"&gt;Muttniks Solidity code&lt;/a&gt; uses no for-loops). To prevent expensive, redundant contract calls, we decided to move some of these queries to the Scala side of things, where they’d execute once on our Heroku instance every few minutes, and then be accessible to a user’s web browser without it having to call any contract code itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/385/1*mR7duXRp6mDtQKyvHuSckA.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.astroledger.org/#/card?externalId=188260&amp;amp;category=1"&gt;Jellybean&lt;/a&gt; isn’t for sale, but it’s hot enough to melt your heart.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was great for querying a user’s star cards, but things became interesting when we needed to query the names that they assigned to stars. As mentioned earlier, rather than put these names in contract storage as we did with auctions and card ownership, we chose to keep a record of star names using Ethereum events: this was intended as a &lt;a href="https://media.consensys.net/technical-introduction-to-events-and-logs-in-ethereum-a074d65dd61e"&gt;less expensive form of storage&lt;/a&gt;. So why not cache &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; on our server? As we soon discovered, &lt;a href="https://web3j.io/"&gt;web3j&lt;/a&gt; (a library similar to web3js that we used for querying the blockchain in Scala) &lt;a href="https://web3j.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filters.html#filters-and-events"&gt;did not support filters&lt;/a&gt; on Infura, the free client we used for accessing the main Ethereum network. Web3js &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; support querying events in the user’s browser, but this had even worse performance effects on the browser than querying ownership, because it would poll the blockchain every second or so to get event information (web3js 1.0 &lt;a href="https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/326"&gt;has since addressed this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a better handle on things, we decided to go closer to the source. In earlier investigations, Tony had coded up some Clojure code to talk directly to Infura’s RPC endpoints. With it running on our server, we could essentially do the same thing as web3js would in someone’s browser, but in one place (for $7/month) and at a longer poll interval. So, we decided to turn it into a full blown service. Coupled with Redis, this gave us our own centralized names cache, which, as with auctions and card ownership, could be accessed in someone’s browser much more quickly than if it were to query the blockchain directly itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Single-Page&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Chief Rubber Taster Jonathan was tasting the rubber over in Tel Aviv when he met the team developing &lt;a href="https://www.portis.io/"&gt;Portis&lt;/a&gt;, a browser based smart-contract enabled wallet. Portis would allow folks to use Ethereum on a vanilla web browser (i.e. without MetaMask installed), including iOS or Android. However, &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/portis-project/Lobby?at=5b4b4f799a612333aa63b400"&gt;since the Portis library only stored user credentials in browser memory&lt;/a&gt;, our initial approach of rendering web pages server-side (where clicking a link would open a brand new page) would oblige users to log in over and over again whenever they navigated anywhere on our site. The solution was to migrate to a &lt;a href="https://tinnedfruit.com/articles/create-your-own-dysfunctional-single-page-app.html"&gt;single page application&lt;/a&gt; that could be downloaded all at once in a user’s web browser, to provide full functionality without a user ever having to refresh the page or log in again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p30-vrUbedjzuNOPeGnMNA.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Easily accessing astroledger.org with Portis, so we can add &lt;a href="https://www.astroledger.org/#/card?externalId=139997&amp;amp;category=1"&gt;Libre&lt;/a&gt; to our star collection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, we settled on &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, since it afforded us the ability to easily use another popular library, &lt;a href="https://github.com/trufflesuite/drizzle-react"&gt;Drizzle-React&lt;/a&gt; to interoperate with web3js in a singly-paged way. However, The Drizzle library itself relied on web3js 1.0, which at the time &lt;a href="https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/3642#issue-307084613"&gt;was not fully compatible with MetaMask&lt;/a&gt;. We eventually abandoned Drizzle, but continued on with React.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Muttniks!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muttniks is a pared down version of the Astro Ledger app, available here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tlazenka/muttniks"&gt;https://github.com/tlazenka/muttniks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get started with Muttniks, head over to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlazenka/muttniks#cheat-sheet"&gt;cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;! The overall structure can be gleaned from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tlazenka/muttniks/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml"&gt;docker compose file&lt;/a&gt;, and by drilling down into each service’s individual list of dependencies (note that some dependencies aren’t relevant to Muttniks, but were used by Astro Ledger). &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/"&gt;Docker compose&lt;/a&gt; is a convenient tool that lets you package up all these fun little services so you can easily launch them together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Docker Compose Services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;app&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main Scala app that sits atop Postgres. When the app is started, it runs the database migrations if needed with &lt;a href="https://flywaydb.org/"&gt;Flyway&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href="http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/2.1.0/code-generation.html"&gt;Slick generates the case classes&lt;/a&gt; from the resulting schema. A periodic task is scheduled with &lt;a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/scheduler.html"&gt;Akka&lt;/a&gt; to query the blockchain with web3j and update the Postgres database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;db/redis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Postgres/Redis databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;jobs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Clojure service that sits atop Redis. When started, it schedules a task with &lt;a href="http://clojurequartz.info/"&gt;Quartzite&lt;/a&gt; to periodically query the local Ethereum blockchain, and caches the results in Redis using &lt;a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine"&gt;Carmine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sbt/lein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centos images that map sbt/ivy2/m2 directories to your local machine to speed up dependency downloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;truffle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Truffle service for compiling the Ethereum contract and running the tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ganache&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://truffleframework.com/ganache"&gt;A Ganache service used here for a local development blockchain.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;react&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The React version of the website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;web3j&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A web3j image that includes the &lt;a href="https://web3j.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html"&gt;command line tools&lt;/a&gt; for generating code from the Truffle JSON artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;firefox&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service with a Firefox browser plus MetaMask that you can access using VNC, you don’t want to install MetaMask in your own browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wrap-Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you are struggling for a reason why Muttniks needs to be on any blockchain… you are not alone in the universe.

If a developer cannot explain in simple terms what a class or module does (to someone who understands the business domain), then that is a code smell. If a class or module is high-cohesion then every part of it should be related in a straight-forward and obvious way and therefore, it should be easy to explain to a new developer who does not understand the low-level details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/@jonathangrosdubois"&gt;- Jonathan Gros-Dubois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.hackernoon.com/t/what-are-the-code-smells-or-antipatterns-that-drive-you-nuts/1214/4"&gt;Add your favourite code smell to the rant, right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.hackernoon.com/t/a-little-motivation-what-are-you-hacking-on-in-your-spare-time/1238"&gt;A little motivation: what are you hacking on in your spare time?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ain’t nobody in the Hacker Noon community got time to let a nine to five get in the way of their passion projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From machine learning based NSFW detection to old-school role playing games, &lt;a href="https://community.hackernoon.com/t/a-little-motivation-what-are-you-hacking-on-in-your-spare-time/1238/2"&gt;go here to get inspired&lt;/a&gt; by the side hustles fellow hackers are working on right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join the discourse @&lt;a href="http://community.hackernoon.com"&gt; community.hackernoon.com&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fupscri.be%2Fdde502%3Fas_embed%3Dtrue&amp;amp;dntp=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fupscri.be%2Fdde502%2F&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fucarecdn.com%2F57662ddc-da7c-407b-afcb-cb45184b2705%2F&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=upscri" width="800" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/d25dd15e8727342107fbe0b6d67b030e/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/d25dd15e8727342107fbe0b6d67b030e/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d194518c21f9" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/shadow-it-makes-developers-scrappy-d194518c21f9"&gt;Shadow IT Makes Developers Scrappy&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 18:51:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Naked Security: Microsoft slaps down 99 APT35/Charming Kitten domains -  Puntaje: 200</title><link>https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/04/01/microsoft-slaps-down-99-apt35-charming-kitten-domains/</link><description>Court order in hand, Microsoft seized control of the hacker group's (which it calls Phosphorous) phishing sites.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 11:29:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Threatpost: ThreatList: Game of Thrones, a Top Malware Conduit for Cybercriminals -  Puntaje: 300</title><link>https://threatpost.com/game-of-thrones-malware-piracy/143318/</link><description>As Game of Thrones' eighth season gets ready to kick off, a new report says the popular TV show accounted for 17 percent of all infected pirated content in the last year.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:40:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Security Affairs: New Linux/DDosMan threat emerged from an evolution of the older Elknot -  Puntaje: 400</title><link>https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/83157/malware/new-linux-ddosman-threat-emerged-from-an-evolution-of-the-older-elknot.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The popular expert unixfreaxjp analyzed a new China ELF DDoS&amp;#8217;er malware tracked as &amp;#8220;Linux/DDoSMan&amp;#8221; that evolves from the Elknot malware to deliver new ELF bot.

&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike’s report reviewed incidents of both eCrime and state-sponsored cyberattacks across the world and found that Russian, China, Iran and North Korea continue to maintain a professional and experienced cybercrime capability which presents a major threat to countries whose political agenda conflicts with the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking ahead of next month’s GISEC, the largest cybersecurity exhibition and conference in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, Dubai-based CrowdStrike Head, Rawad Sarieddine, said: "Many nation states including Iran sustained a moderate operations tempo throughout 2018. Saudi Arabia continued to be the primary regional target for this actor, however, the use of Bahrain-themed spear- phishing underscores tensions between Iran and Bahrain. Governments and businesses need to be aware of the threat they present and be prepared to deal with that threat."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report indicates that entities in the UAE and Saudi government, defence and NGO sectors will continue to be the targets of these operations of potentially unfriendly government is seeking geopolitical prominence, both in the region and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our report has found that Iran along with other threat actors continues to be a destructive threat — not only within the Middle East but also to companies based in Western countries that may do business or maintain infrastructure in the region,” said Sarieddine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At GISEC, CrowdStrike will present a Secret Briefing titled: Combatting today’s advanced attacker: Key trends, predictions and the need for speed, to provide delegates with insights and real-world examples of how cybercriminals combine advanced, targeted attack techniques with ransomware to cause massive financial loss and how CrowdStrike’s Threat Hunting team are able to spot and deal with threats quickly before significant impact to the corporate network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During our Secret Briefing, we will help delegates understand how threat hunting can be used to identify and stop advanced attacks in our environment, and how to defend organisations against advanced attacks,” said the session’s presenter Roland Daccache, Security Engineer at CrowdStrike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CrowdStrike Falcon platform remains the only next-generation endpoint protection solution that unifies next-generation antivirus (AV), IT Hygiene, endpoint detection and response (EDR), threat intelligence, and managed hunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About CrowdStrike®&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike is the leader in cloud-delivered endpoint protection. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform offers instant visibility and protection across the enterprise and prevents attacks on endpoints on or off the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Gartner, Inc. predicts that by 2023, 50% of the roles that government CIOs will oversee do not exist in government IT today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent Gartner CIO survey shows that the transition to digital government is gaining momentum. It found that 53 percent of digital initiatives in government organizations have moved from the design stage to early stages of delivering digitally driven outcomes. This is up from 40% last year. Additionally, 39% of governments expect cloud services to be a technology area where they will spend the greatest amount of new or additional funding in 2019. “These findings demonstrate that leadership has become more comfortable with cloud delivery models and has moved away from concerns regarding security and data ownership,” said Cathleen Blanton, research vice president at Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to digital business means that the IT organization needs to adapt to new skills requirements,” Ms. Blanton said. “In many governments, roles of chief data officers and cloud architects are already present. However, it is worth noting that 38% of government respondents did not introduce any new roles in 2018 due to insufficient resources, skills and cultural issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To adapt to new skill requirements, CIOs need to initiate a transformation process that results in new or changed roles. For example, as cloud services become more prevalent, the number of data center management roles will decline. Furthermore, the emergence of digital product management is changing how governments think about their services, and this will lead to the emergence of digital teams internally to design and deliver products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, government IT will also accomplish more diversified tasks than today. Public sector agencies will rely on government IT services to address inclusion, citizen experience and digital ethics. Those fields require new types of skillsets, such as researchers, designers and social scientists. “Government CIOs must employ experts to model and explain how citizens and businesses will need to respond to regulations and policies, and what impact that will have on society, the economy and government revenues,” Ms. Blanton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, government IT will need to assign new roles to support their digital transformation and introduce emerging technologies in diverse businesses and mission areas. As artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of things (IoT) technologies advance, machine trainers, conversational specialists and automation experts will slowly but certainly replace experts in legacy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything-as-a-Service on the Rise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gartner predicts that by 2023, over 80% of new technology solutions adopted by governments will be delivered and supported using an anything-as-a-service (XaaS) model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XaaS summarizes several categories of IT, including those delivered in the cloud as a subscription-based service. It also encompasses managed desktop, help desk and network services, voice over IP and unified communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Adoption of XaaS models is increasing across all industries globally – primarily driven by cloud services - and government is no exception,” said Alia Mendonsa, senior director analyst at Gartner. “The model offers an alternative to legacy infrastructure modernization and investment. It’s a promising way to scale digital government, because it can provide small local offerings as well as nation-wide services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the XaaS model also creates new challenges for government CIOs. In the early stages of adoption, business units may turn less to the IT department to deliver solutions, as they are now able to acquire XaaS solutions without the involvement or the resources of IT. This is a dangerous endeavor as departments often lack the knowledge to negotiate complex contracts and individual departments may be independently acquiring duplicative capabilities already offered centrally. Furthermore, as-a-service contracting is still immature and often offers weak service levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For this reason, CIOs must educate business units about the risks associated with this type of contracting and need to take an active role in negotiating these contracts wherever possible,” Ms. Mendonsa said. “Without the support and experience of their IT organization, an XaaS solution can create significant risks to the organization and the citizens it serves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
