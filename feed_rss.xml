&lt;div&gt;Online search interest in the UAE for cryptocurrencies closely follows the price fluctuations of leading digital assets, according to a recent research report from SEMrush, a prominent digital marketing suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global research found that searches conducted online in the UAE echoed other markets and overall global trends in a decreasing interest in cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin’s exchange rates spiked to a historical high in December 2017. During the same month, global online searches for Bitcoin also hit a high of just over 40 million searches, before dipping to around five million average monthly searches globally during the proceeding eight months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The correlation between cryptocurrency search volumes and Bitcoin exchange rates was much higher globally in early 2018, but today there appears to be a much weaker correlation between online search volumes and the exchange rates,” commented Adam Zeidan Corporate Communications Manager for SEMrush in MENA region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEMrush report shows that UAE online search volumes for ‘cryptocurrency’ also spiked in December 2017. Again, echoing global trends, UAE online searches have since dropped and now remain behind the monthly average online search volumes related to traditional, or general, financial trading terms such as ‘stock market’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEMrush highlighted that the second most searched cryptocurrency in the UAE after Bitcoin is Ripple. Average monthly searches for Bitcoin in the UAE dropped from 100,000 searches a month during the spike in exchange rates in early 2018 to the current level of 15,000 searches a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for specific blockchain-related searches in the UAE, the top spot was for healthcare related blockchain, which registered around 1,000 average monthly searches. This was followed by blockchain for banking, security, insurance and real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Twitter sentiment on cryptocurrency in the UAE today is also showing a substantially large neutral audience, which could be either indifference, lack of awareness, or both. Sentiment on cryptocurrency stands at 54.4 per cent neutral, 38.8 per cent positive and 6.7 per cent negative,” pointed out Zeidan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto struggles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin enthusiast Tim Draper predicted we will all be using Bitcoin in the near future and only criminals will be left dealing with cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, the Bitcoin picture is still not clear, if not gloomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s price has dragged in bear market territory, with investors and traders saw the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fall by more than $400 billion in a little over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former IMF Chief Economist Kenneth Rogoff believes that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently amount to little more than “lottery tickets” at this moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced economies have so far refrained from fully adopting cryptocurrencies in their current form because, among others, of their capacity to attract money launderers. Cryptos’ anonymity is integral and if that aspect of the currency is lost, so will their mass appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to CCN, Hollywood already has a sinister opinion about Bitcoin. The new film “Crypto” pushes the bitcoin-money laundering narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the security of this decentralized blockchain financial system is subject to a constant barrage of attacks, an online version of Bonnie and Clyde being replicated globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 7th January 2019, Ethereum Classic took the brunt of a malicious attack by hackers who stole around $460,000 in what was called a 51% attack. Hackers gained the ability to ‘reorganise’ a blockchain or even replace one with their own version. On top of this, hackers are now able to ‘double spend’, meaning the same coins can be used several times on different occasions for maleficent transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of coins stolen in 2018 was 3.6 times higher than in 2017 and reached $1.7bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Put the wrong number of zeroes in your Excel spreadsheet and it will unthinkingly pay your staff pennies on the pound; train a self-driving car to recognise human figures by showing it millions of pictures of white people, and it might struggle to identify pedestrians of other races.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.11097.pdf" title=""&gt;finding of researchers from Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt;, who analysed how effective various “machine vision” systems were at recognising pedestrians with different skin tones. The results were alarming: AI systems were consistently better at identifying pedestrians with lighter skin tones than darker.

                &lt;br&gt;The word “blockchain” has been occupying a lot of news headlines recently. Every day, we learn about new startups being launched to solve notorious issues in an entirely new way – all by utilizing the blockchain technology. Generally speaking, it comes as no surprise to hear that technology built to power cryptocurrencies has disrupted the banking and financing sector. After all, cryptocurrencies are an integral part of it, so we could say that blockchain’s contribution to this industry was pretty much expected, if not obvious. However, blockchain has also found implementations in industries where we are not quite used to see advanced information technology. For example, we might wonder how it could help with public affairs or existing voting systems. Things like identity theft, fake documents, or inefficient public administration could all become things of the past thanks to the blockchain’s features such as immutability and sustainability of records.

&lt;div&gt;The transaction banking industry is undergoing considerable transformation and is thriving through change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From coping with a slew of new market entrants, innovation and an emerging generation of human capital to payment disruptions, geopolitical turbulence and economic shifts, the banking industry in the UAE has pulled through a lot with its head held high. All this and more was discussed at the BAFT MENA Bank to Bank forum, specifically in the fireside chat between Tod Burwell, President and CEO, BAFT and Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair, CEO of Mashreq Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The UAE GDP is projected to grow at 3.5 percent and the banking sector is expected to grow at 6.5 percent in 2019. This is a decent growth rate compared to countries in other parts of the world. The UAE also boasts decent capital adequacy, with the average standing at 18 percent, which will help us to grow," said Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair, CEO of Mashreq Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming challenges to growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UAE banking sector has sufficient liquidity and is ready for good growth in 2019. This means that the UAE needs its economy to keep growing to facilitate the growth of the banking sector. Although the economy has faced challenges over the past few years, it has weathered the storm and has kept moving toward its credible, mature growth targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming months will bring their share of challenges. The transactional banking sector is keeping a keen eye on real estate, for instance. If the rates fluctuate beyond a point that the consumer can bear the burden, banks will have to ease that burden on the consumer by taking proactive measures such as increasing the term of loan repayment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The UAE DNA is made of seven Emirates. We love competition in each Emirate. This is one of the key areas that have fueled growth - not only competition with the region, but also competition within the region. The interest in the business community was built around that. The time has, now, come to consolidate. We are yet to see a condition wherein free shareholders see the benefit in consolidation. We see businesses that are Dubai-based, Abu Dhabi-based, RAK-based and so on. We are yet to see inter-Emirate consolidation," Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banking sector also faces the challenge of compliance. It is not sufficient to be compliant merely with UAE regulators; it is equally important to be compliant with international regulators and the individual regulators in countries across the globe. Any transaction could have touch points in various countries. With compliance regulations changing every so often, followed by the need to implement these changes and modify technology and AML programs based on these changes, it is becoming a challenge to stay abreast with the compliance requirements across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cybercrime is also a major concern. The remittance limits are also growing. Transactions go into 50 million or 100 million dollars. So we need to be extremely careful on cybersecurity and we must enhance it. This is a major threat facing us," Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major disruptors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UAE is also likely to see major disruptors in the UAE banking sector - small, digital banks who focus on niche markets and start grabbing market share from larger banks. This is especially important given the UAE's high adoption rate of mobile phones and digital banking in the retail sector. The adaptation of digital strategies has been slower in the corporate than in retail, but the success of retail is driving the digital adaptation in corporate banking as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of the banking sector will see straight-through digital processing of most transactions, with manual inclusion only where necessary to meet compliance requirements. This means that transactions such as remittances can be completely tracked hour-by-hour digitally without the need for call centers or other such human intervention. This could also mean the closure of bank branches, as workflows become digital. This means that there will always be a high necessity to retrain, redeploy the existing workforce while recruiting at least one-third of the new workforce with tech-trade expertise. This will mean ensuring that employees have better tools and investing in replacing legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UAE banking sector will also need to take positive strides toward artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, and blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, the banking sector also faces the threat that arrives from the work culture created by big tech companies. The work culture in tech giants is quite liberating compared to the more rigid work structures imposed on employees within the banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geopolitical trade tensions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China trade fallout has rocked the equilibrium that the world enjoyed over the past few years. However, the UAE is fortunate inasmuch as it is likely to benefit from whatever the outcome of this "trade war" is likely to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If China shifts its focus from the U.S. to alternative markets, whether Asia or Africa, the UAE is in a good position to facilitate Chinese expansion into Africa or Central Asia. The UAE has great ports, excellent infrastructure, air connectivity as well as immense growth potential in innovation and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
