Here will be reviewed the main private blockchains in the article, as well as highlight the key similarities and differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, private blockchains are the complete opposite of public blockchains. In public blockchains, anyone can participate because it is open to everyone and anyone can read, write and audit information within the blockchain, however, that is not the case with private blockchains unless one has permission to do so. In private blockchains the owner is usually a single entity, that is why it is not, in its true sense, decentralized. It is more of a distributed data ledger with embedded cryptographic protection in it. However, that is not a drawback but another concept. The private blockchain is supposed to be faster and cheaper than its public analog because the system does not need to spend high amounts of energy, time and money to reach consensus here. But from another point of view, it is relatively less secure and non-transparent as opposed to public blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the differences above are a good way to identify which blockchain is better suited for a specific use case, there are similarities between both types which can make it confusing to make the right choice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both types of blockchains are somewhat decentralized and represent P2P distributed ledger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both types contain a replica of the blockchain on each full node which gets updated with consensus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both types of blockchain provide immutability, however, this may be not equal, because immutability is highly dependent on the underlying blockchain architecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both types of blockchain can be used by both enterprises and the public, however, we note that enterprises are more likely to use private ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Private Blockchains overview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ldz3wcC5fbmUR60v" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@firmbee?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;William Iven&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here will be reviewed most popular private blockchains and their usage and mining statistics. Most of them are well-known for people in crypto and some of them are released an only month ago, but each of them has its advantages and technical features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Monero&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monero is technically a Bytecoin fork which utilizes the CryptoNote protocol for one of the layers, Ring Signatures for transaction signing, Ring CT for transaction hiding and Stealth Addresses for the purpose of hiding the users’ addresses. Upon creation of an address, a user receives three keys — 1 for review incoming transaction and balance, 1 for sending and 1 public key. 3rd parties can review addresses and transaction only having the review key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monero team is currently developing Kovri Project which will route and encrypt transactions using I2P Invisible Internet Project nodes. This will help to hide transactors’ IP addresses and provide further protection from external monitoring. In addition to the above, Monero is ASIC-resistant proof of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the most interesting statistics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The top-3 mining pools accumulate almost &lt;strong&gt;72% of the network hash rate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For now, there are more than &lt;strong&gt;5700 connected miners&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monero’s block reward per any given time period (per minute or per day) is always higher than Bitcoin’s, except for the time period between 2019 and 2027/2028 (almost one decade).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2040 we see the &lt;strong&gt;intersection point of identical coin supply for Monero and Bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt; (both nearly 21 Million coins).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After 2040, Monero’s coin supply will continue to grow linearly (not exponentially like fiat currencies) and exceed that of Bitcoin, exceeding the 21 Million value and &lt;strong&gt;continuously increasing by 157788 XMR each year&lt;/strong&gt; [this number takes leap years into account], or 0.3 XMR/min = &lt;strong&gt;0.6 XMR/2min&lt;/strong&gt;, forever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can never know the top addresses and their balances because Monero is fully private.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monero’s mining difficulty based on the &lt;strong&gt;last 720 blocks&lt;/strong&gt;, excluding 20% of the timestamp outliers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Block time, for now, is&lt;strong&gt; 2 mins&lt;/strong&gt; and may change in the future as long as the emission curve is preserved&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;ZCash&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ZCash blockchain is built based on the Bitcoin blockchain, with zk-SNARK technology embedded, which allows private transactions and hides private address balances. There are two types of addresses in ZCash blockchain — private (starting with “z”) and public (starting with “t”), therefore there are four types of transactions available. “Mixed”, private-to-public transactions are hidden only from the private side. Private addresses may also send encrypted messages within private transactions. The owner of private addresses may also reveal information regarding his transactions to regulators and auditors, however, the addresses of counterparties cannot be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the most interesting statistics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the fact that private transactions on the ZCash blockchain represent 20% of transactions in terms of amount, in terms of volume they make up only &lt;strong&gt;3.3%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most nodes of ZCash for last month come from Germany (&lt;strong&gt;89 nodes&lt;/strong&gt;), US (84 nodes), France (69 nodes) and China (27 nodes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4,964&lt;/strong&gt; unique nodes for all time, &lt;strong&gt;425&lt;/strong&gt; for the last month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Almost &lt;strong&gt;40%&lt;/strong&gt; of blocks mined relate to single mining pool — Flypool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The total amount of addresses is more than &lt;strong&gt;3 million&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16.3%&lt;/strong&gt; of transactions are private.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;88,612 transparent transactions amounting to &lt;strong&gt;45,939,248 ZEC&lt;/strong&gt; and 14,491 private transactions amounting to &lt;strong&gt;343,838 ZEC&lt;/strong&gt; for last month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4,828,605 ZEC&lt;/strong&gt; cumulative miners reward for all time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;DASH&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;DASH is built based on Bitcoin blockchain and it has 2 different types of nodes (on the contrary to is “parent”) — usual nodes and masternodes, which have the ability to privately sending and quick-sending of transactions (around 1 second). DASH uses CoinJoin protocol and utilizes I2P Invisible Internet Project nodes technology for privacy purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the most interesting statistics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;26% of all master nodes are located in the US, 19% in the Netherlands, 11% in Germany, 9,2% in Lithuania and 8.2% in France.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5,000&lt;/strong&gt; active master nodes and 5 are inactive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The top-100 addresses contain &lt;strong&gt;15.29% &lt;/strong&gt;of all coins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The top-10 addresses contain &lt;strong&gt;5.93%&lt;/strong&gt; of all coins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On average &lt;strong&gt;545 blocks&lt;/strong&gt; every day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40% of Hashrate&lt;/strong&gt; from Genesis Mining pool&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On average &lt;strong&gt;349&lt;/strong&gt; transactions hourly, each transaction is circa &lt;strong&gt;15.1 DASH&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As of 2018 coins were mined using a proof of work algorithm with a hash function called “X11”, with eleven rounds of hashing, and the average time to mine a coin was around &lt;strong&gt;two a half minutes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Dash DAO uses the &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt; it receives from mining to invest as the DAO chooses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Running a masternode requires ownership of &lt;strong&gt;1000 Dash&lt;/strong&gt;. Masternodes are also required to have a static IP address and meet minimum requirements for CPU, RAM, disk space and network bandwidth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;PIVX&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIVX is based on DASH technology, so the key main features of PIVX are the same, however, PIVX utilizes the PoS protocol of Zerocoin for consensus whereas DASH is PoW. The network speed of PIVX is circa 170 TPS. In addition to the above, PIVX team is globally decentralized with no central ruling company. The project is maintained by the community. The project is also claiming itself to be energy-efficient with an estimate of 1 wind turbine to fully power the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the most interesting statistics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The total amount of addresses is &lt;strong&gt;88681&lt;/strong&gt;, 34945 of which were active last month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30% of coins&lt;/strong&gt; are locked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top-100 addresses contain over &lt;strong&gt;43% &lt;/strong&gt;of all coins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top-10 addresses contain about&lt;strong&gt; 21% &lt;/strong&gt;of all coins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over &lt;strong&gt;29%&lt;/strong&gt; of stakers based in the US, 18% in Germany and 9% in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1746&lt;/strong&gt; active masternodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;138,062&lt;/strong&gt; addresses in use at all time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2,651,183&lt;/strong&gt; confirmed transactions in the blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11,926&lt;/strong&gt; addresses hodl coins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ALL transaction &amp;amp; zPIV minting fees are burnt from coin supply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Verge&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verge is based on the Bitcoin blockchain with multiple layers for privacy. One of the layers is Tor for hiding IP addresses and the other is I2P, similar to Dash for privacy purposes, as well. Verge has a built-in Wraith protocol which allows the choice between private and public network somewhat similar to ZCash. Verge uses a PoW protocol, however, there are 5 different mining algorithms, each of which takes 30 seconds to execute, which provides protection from 51% of attacks. The verge team also claims to support atomic swaps between blockchains that support BIP65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the most interesting statistics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The top-25 addresses contain &lt;strong&gt;49.41%&lt;/strong&gt; of all coins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The top-100 addresses contain &lt;strong&gt;95.59%&lt;/strong&gt; of all coins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Half a minute for mining each block.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;660,987&lt;/strong&gt; transactions in all time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total supply is fixed and equals to &lt;strong&gt;16,500,000,000 XVG&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uses next mining algorithms — scrypt, x17, Lyra2rev2, myr-groestl, &amp;amp; blake2s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In average &lt;strong&gt;1,412&lt;/strong&gt; transactions each day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than &lt;strong&gt;41%&lt;/strong&gt; of all nodes in the US (46 nodes), &lt;strong&gt;9.8%&lt;/strong&gt; in the UK (11 nodes) and &lt;strong&gt;8.9%&lt;/strong&gt; in Germany (10 nodes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Bitcoin Private&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTCp is a fork-merge of ZClassic and Bitcoin, which allows for 4 different types of transactions. BTCp utilizes ZCash’s zk-SNARK tech to hide transactions. BTCp utilizes a PoW protocol similar to the one of Bitcoin Gold, therefore, having same block time. The team is currently developing the Dandelion protocol, which will improve the security of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total supply of BTCp should have been the sum of the total BTC supply at BTCp launch date plus the total supply of ZClassic at the same date plus 62,500 BTCp under Volutary Mining Contribution Program. However, the actual &lt;a href="https://coinmetrics.io/bitcoin-private/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amount of BTCp upon launch was higher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it should have been. You can read more about this vulnerability and understand what could be wrong with this project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the most interesting statistics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The top-1 address in ZClassic possesses &lt;strong&gt;48,56%&lt;/strong&gt; of all coins, top-25 — almost &lt;strong&gt;73%&lt;/strong&gt;. Since Bitcoin Private is a fork of ZClassic and Bitcoin, they received a huge amount of coins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt; sponsored mining pools, &lt;strong&gt;32&lt;/strong&gt; mining pools were confirmed by the BTCp team and 5 pools were unconfirmed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was no premine, and there is no founder’s reward. Hard Fork was at blocks &lt;strong&gt;511346&lt;/strong&gt; for BTC and &lt;strong&gt;272991&lt;/strong&gt; for ZCL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin Private has been released in a fair manner to all. Coins were distributed on a &lt;strong&gt;1:1&lt;/strong&gt; basis to BTC (segwit &amp;amp; normal) and ZCL (t &amp;amp; z) holders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;MimbleWimble Grin&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;MimbleWimble is a blockchain format and protocol which provides scalability, fungibility, and privacy. Grin is an open source project which implements MimbleWimble blockchain and provides blockchain environment. Grin has privacy by default and also allows for the partial disclosure of information if need be. The Grin blockchain scale in relation to the number of users and minimally in relation to the number of transactions, because of the check that each new transaction does not have any new coins, previous blocks can be removed without concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on that, the Grin blockchain takes much less disk space in comparison with competitors. The blockchain itself is simply designed and easy-to-audit and maintain. The Grin blockchain utilized time-proven Elliptic Curves which have been used for decades. The Grin blockchain is developed by the community, utilized ASIC-resistant algorithm (Cuckoo Cycle) while encouraging miner decentralization. It also supports sidechains and Quantum-resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the most interesting statistics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first four years of Bitcoin emission rate are identical to the first four of Grin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every year that passes makes the overall dilution smaller. After 10 years, this falls below&lt;strong&gt; 10%&lt;/strong&gt;. After 20, below &lt;strong&gt;5%&lt;/strong&gt;. After 25 years Grin will have 4% supply inflation, the same as Bitcoin 10 years after its genesis (2018).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;257,610&lt;/strong&gt; transactions in all time, there mined only more than &lt;strong&gt;72,900&lt;/strong&gt; blocks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Outro&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*k1ZZVTOdaVrHPuqs" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@crew?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Crew&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There is definitely a lot of banks that are interested in private blockchains. In some cases, they are happy with public blockchains as well. The opposition to just doing things on a public blockchain is definitely smaller than some of the strongest detractors think.&lt;br&gt; — Vitalik Buterin&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the private blockchains has its own features, mainly related to the privacy of the data and has its own strong and weak sides. However, even though blockchain technology itself is still in its early stage and the whole market is tiny when compared to other markets, private blockchain share is even tinier — even on well-known blockchains focusing on privacy (like ZCash) still have relatively low volumes of transactions when compared to their public rivals. Regardless of that, private blockchains definitely have their customers and market, therefore their development is not in vain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that private blockchains implement technical solutions which have proven their relative effectiveness in privacy protection like Tor, I2P, etc. However, there is no such thing as absolute privacy and 100% anonymity, and the attacks against privacy are getting better. One should use common sense, prudence and in-depth cautiousness to keep their privacy safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e50929ab8706" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/private-blockchains-overview-and-stats-e50929ab8706"&gt;Private Blockchains Overview and Stats&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 16:36:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>CoinDesk: Coinbase Leads Wall Street to Brave New World of Crypto Staking -  Puntaje: 300</title><link>https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-leads-wall-street-to-brave-new-world-of-crypto-staking</link><description>Coinbase Custody has launched staking services for institutional clients, starting with Tezos and touting 6.6 percent yields.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 08:04:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Cointelegraph: Bitmain Announces Launch Date for Antminer S17 Series -  Puntaje: 400</title><link>https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmain-announces-launch-date-for-antminer-s17-series</link><description>&lt;img src="https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/528_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9hMTIzNzQwZDkyMjNiZDc1OGI0N2FiYTBmMGUwMDRiOC5qcGc=.jpg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese crypto mining giant  Bitmain has announced a launch date for its new energy-efficient Antminer S17 series miners&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 16:14:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Cointelegraph: Japanese E-commerce Giant Rakuten to Launch Its Crypto Exchange in June -  Puntaje: 500</title><link>https://cointelegraph.com/news/japanese-e-commerce-giant-rakuten-to-launch-its-crypto-exchange-in-june</link><description>&lt;img src="https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/528_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8xZDQ4OTRiNDY5ZWQ1NTliMmMwMjE2NzViYWVjMWIzMy5qcGc=.jpg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten announced the launch date for its crypto exchange, dubbed Rakuten Wallet, following its approval by the FSA&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 16:38:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Cointelegraph: Indian Street Protests for Cryptocurrency -  Puntaje: 900</title><link>https://cointelegraph.com/news/indian-street-protests-for-cryptocurrency</link><description>&lt;img src="https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/528_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9hZDZlNTI0OTcwYmE1YTU0YzYxMWQyOWUwNDA4YzgxYS5qcGc=.jpg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian developers are set to protest the ban on crypto.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 14:19:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Fortune: A Crypto Dividend?

New attacks are unleashed every day, and companies around the world lose millions of dollars as a result.

The only thing standing in the way of cybercrime is a small army of ethical hackers. These cybersecurity experts are employed to find weaknesses before they can be exploited.

Such is its popularity, however, that cyber attackers and online thieves continue attempting to steal coins using whatever means possible. No matter how technologically savvy you are, if you &lt;a href="https://www.xcoins.com"&gt;buy Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, you need to make sure that they are stored safely and securely. Here are four tips to help keep your bitcoins secured from theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Choose a Strong Password&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost everything online can be safeguarded from unwanted and inappropriate access if it’s effectively password protected. That said, many people use the same passwords for multiple accounts, from social media to email and shopping platforms, which makes them easy targets for hackers. If you use the same password for your email address and just one other platform, for example, all it takes is for a hacker to retrieve the password for the other platform and they have instant access to your email account, which gives them access to everything else you do online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/743/1*s0UIC6QYHWdTC2hD41wCZQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoins are stored in a virtual wallet, making it vital that you use a strong password to protect it. It’s also good practice to regularly change your wallet password — and, by extension, passwords for all of your online accounts — every few months. This way, you can ensure that no one will be able to guess your Bitcoin wallet password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re running out of ideas, consider a secure password management system such as &lt;a href="https://www.lastpass.com/"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;, which will generate long and complex passwords comprising random characters and secure them on your laptop or PC for access without having to remember all your unique passwords. For additional security, enable two-factor authentication, which means you need your password and an additional piece of information, such as a code sent to your mobile phone, before being able to log in to your password management tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Select the Right Kind of Wallet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opting for a strong password is essential, but what’s more important is the kind of wallet you choose to store your bitcoins. There are multiple wallet types, and the one you choose will depend on your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first type is the typical cloud wallet (accessible from both mobile and desktop), which is best compared to PayPal. In the same way that PayPal lets you store and access money from your bank account — and pay for items directly via PayPal, a cloud wallet allows you to store and access bitcoins from anywhere. If you’re a beginner and don’t have any bitcoins, a cloud wallet is your quick and easy option, as they’re simple to set up and use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RhwsEZgK4S_XSYeSuwbCWA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another option you can consider for storing your bitcoins is a hardware wallet. This is a USB stick-like device, in which you can store all your private keys easily. Since these wallets can be disconnected from an internet-enabled computer as soon as your work is done, a hacker’s chance of accessing the information stored on it reduces significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For added security, keep your hardware wallet and its backup key in separate places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do large ticket-size Bitcoin transactions worth over tens of thousands of dollars every month, then it’s better to add one more security layer to your Bitcoin wallet. This can be done by opting for paper wallets instead of a cloud or hardware alternative. As they’re not connected to the internet, there is no way hackers can access any information stored on them online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s crucial to run a malware check on your computer before generating paper wallets and disconnect it from the internet before creating any keys. Before you reconnect to the internet, destroy any Bitcoins footprint on your device, which will ensure that hackers won’t be able to access your information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Don’t Access Wallets from Public Computers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how urgently you might need to access your account, never be tempted to access your Bitcoin information using a public computer used by many other users throughout the day. For checking your Bitcoin balance and sending or receiving coins, always use your personal computer or laptop and make sure it’s password secured, equipped with the latest malware protection and isn’t used by anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Enable Multi-Signature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When multi-signature is enabled, a user has to have access to two or more wallet keys in order to process any transaction. Similar to two-factor authentication on certain websites, multi-sig means that even if a hacker has a private key, they need to have an additional key to execute the transaction. However, this added security feature is most effective when you can trust another person with your Bitcoin keys, so consider this before opting for this method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you follow these steps, you’ll minimize the risk of a hacker getting access to your Bitcoin wallet and keep your cryptocurrency secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9815e50b9480" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-keep-your-bitcoins-safe-from-online-theft-9815e50b9480"&gt;How to Keep Your Bitcoins Safe from Online Theft&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 15:36:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hackernoon: The Future of Staying Safe Online Now -  Puntaje: 30000</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-future-of-staying-safe-online-now-c078e740e0f?source=rss----3a8144eabfe3---4</link><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/320/1*99kMvFOjjUpbOyiVndzkNw.gif" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Empowering [People] with Next-Generation Cybersecurity R&amp;amp;D, Tools and Education&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A movement towards more self-reliant technology consumers by Steven Hatzakis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h3&gt;🌐 👭👫👬&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article explores why consumers will inevitably seek to become more self-reliant 💪 when protecting themselves against cybersecurity risks, to help bring light to our darkened web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ImdR8ciliNxfMaePzVTTHQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: Steven Hatzakis art, celestial constellation map of north polar projection&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the increasing threats faced on the world wide web, 😇 online web users and their 💻 devices are increasingly at risk.

Facebook failed to properly secure those passwords in their database, as those plaintext secrets where found not to be encrypted when they should have. 😲&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if a strong password was chosen, they weren’t protected properly (as &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/3126f7dd42c1"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt; also explains &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/03/23/facebooks-password-breach-suggests-the-public-sees-cybersecurity-as-obsolete/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) due to the negligent absence of encryption. 🛂&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the number of breaches that continue to hit the mainstream media (and potentially countless more yet to be announced or detected), users’ trust has been continually eroded. 😞&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*043viDBoitzTNMEX" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many trusted platforms have been subject to repeated data breaches which have become the new “normal” and leading to greater distrust of a company’s ability to guarantee security for consumers. Perhaps consumers are too reliant. 😉&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Observations:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology giants may be losing their grasp on loyal consumers as trust erodes from privacy/security breaches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumers are still utterly reliant on services like Google, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/4f3f4ee0f977"&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;/ Amazon / AWS, or payments providers (Visa, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/4c9920b6e879"&gt;PayPal Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, etc..) and major banks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of educational resources and cyber tools may it harder for consumers to protect themselves without overly relying on 3rd parties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The modern corporation, and future collective/cooperative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital markets are vital for economic prosperity, yet shareholder incentives must be aligned with the incentives of end users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*X4Tuu1jhYF9kfpPG" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: &lt;a

not one at the other’s expense (a challenge that open public blockchains are trying to figure out with experimental governance and incentive models using cryptography and creative blockchain technology recipes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Engineering Challenges:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Game theory and economic incentives 🎮 💰&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Governance models that

more errors).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*qTbd1uCNBmeFVJeG" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a

free 🚫 🆓&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many such services that appear free to users but comes at some cost (i.e. a ‘free’ google search), as the clues and data left behind by users are of great value when re-sold to advertisers, marketers, researchers, and State actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data is valuable but users don’t have a way to directly unlock that value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Freemium Takeaway:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many free services are not entirely free&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Value is extracted but not always directly

🕵 📈&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as defense becomes a more valuable sector in times of war, cybersecurity is becoming a valuable sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years the cyber sector has branched out further to encompass additional electronic and digital commerce industries where cryptographic security has become a necessity to safeguard market participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, over $1.8b was raised for cybersecurity startups, according to data from &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/914088e570e"&gt;CB Insights&lt;/a&gt; 📊.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analogies of monetizing data to monetizing money 💲 🏦&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, some of the value captured from consumer data within an industry like social media should go back to consumers who would be compensated for their data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This need to compensate users for their data is analogous to what an account holder expects in terms of earning interest from within a checking account even as the bank re-hypothecates those funds for use elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Fintech Service Providers:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compensate users more, not just shareholders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create public utilities that are open (open-source)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encourage self-reliance and set those expectations in terms &amp;amp; conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to fix the problem: you are the solution 🆘&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparable to banking (but worse) much of the modern web is so highly inefficient that it is as good as broken and change is needed at the infrastructure level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the value is captured at the protocol level and shared with the public (compared to the application layer), it does no good if users cannot be more self-sovereign over their data. For example, matters like the self-custody of digital assets or other plain-text secrets relating to privacy/security and personal data should be controlled by their respective owners in an ideal world (i.e. power to the people). ⚡️&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*4k1Vjsg5jbY1hhfL" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My point is that there is an opportunity for change and to fix things, but it’s the end user [you] that needs to regain power as companies alone cannot be expected to be our guardians, which is why &lt;em&gt;I think greater self-reliance is inevitable for the greater-good and safeguarding users on the web&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then we remain helplessly reliant on many services and at the mercy of the cybersecurity risks, yet we can act to reduce those risks and regain defensive power to deter the growing array of threats online including phishing (i.e. typosquatting from bogus emails, sites, and program executable files that appear genuine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Actionable Steps:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer education will help empower change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software changes in UI/UX design leading to new tools and experiences&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Defend against cybersquatting/phishing (i.e. here is a &lt;a href="https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/"&gt;quiz from Google&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RBUVKK7J0QpEYx_i" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using cybersecurity tools, the good 😃 and the bad 💩&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While plenty of tools exist on the dark web and that are often used offensively by bad actors to do harm to others, consumers literally remain in the dark, as they do not have access to equally powerful tools that could be used for defensive purposes, unless they rely on third parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Examples of Cybersecurity Tools and limitations:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kali Linux and penetration testing software (can cause damage if misused)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vulnerable Password managers (can expose password)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Privacy hoarding VPNs (may not protect privacy)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leaky Firewalls (may not prevent hackers)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bug-prone end-to-end encrypted services (may not protect data)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaches 👎 and the need to reduce the ‘quantity’ of trust 👍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that third parties are subject to breaches, as we’ve discussed, where consumers end up becoming the victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bWYzI8GSCQ5Cez1-" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There must be ways that consumers can take greater responsibility to protect themselves, and that is what I am writing about here, including tools that are available albeit remain mostly complex and hard to access without relying on trusted third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, my goal is to help users minimize the trust they expend, not eliminate it completely (not yet), as some level of trust is always needed at some level.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The building blocks of cybersecurity ➕ ✖️ ➗ ➖&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers remain largely unsafe against hackers or data compromises due to data privacy leaks and a growing landscape of cybersecurity risks, thus empowering consumers directly seems like a logical next step as we enter deeper into a greater need for cybersecurity.

And what can consumers do to protect themselves without the need to be as reliant on others and instead be more self-reliant on their own defenses against these risks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the types of questions I think about and which lead me to the inevitable conclusion of an upcoming trend of 👉 &lt;strong&gt;self-reliant and empowered internet users 👊&lt;/strong&gt;which we discuss below in ways to shine some light on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Examples are not meant to be exhaustive:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;📱Use of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (but be sure to backup recovery key before syncing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;✉️ Securing any secondary email addresses listed as recovery addresses on main email accounts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;📪 Disabling Two-Step Verification (2SV) for any security-dependent services to reduce SIM port hacking risks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combine the use of a VPN along with manually setting DNS (i.e. &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/a00e599743a7"&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://1.1.1.1/"&gt;https://1.1.1.1/&lt;/a&gt; service)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🔎Learn to inspect code even if it looks unintelligible to the untrained user&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;🖥 Learn to run command line operations and apps from a terminal window&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;❓Ask questions and research answers and be responsible for your own due diligence/opinion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;❓Question security assumptions and go deeper layer by layer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*oNADqS61oyu8fPjy" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empowering the light web ☀️ 👥&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem most internet users face in protecting themselves online is that the cybersecurity tools that consumers could theoretically use to protect themselves are often too complex to run manually, even though they are readily available today (links further below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Cyber complexity challenges for users:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One mistake can make a secure process insecure (i.e. reusing the same salt/key and initialization vector to encrypt different messages).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less room for error (i.e. no reset button)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greater attention to detail required&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Takes time to learn new approaches/methods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*_50Q12oI2jWDhluD" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expected security assumptions in terms of bits 🔬&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryptographic primitives will change over time, as they will be used so long as they are perceived to be safe and up until they are no longer secure. In advance of that convergence point (when old methods are no longer as secure relative to the risks), new methods are used to replace the old primitives ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VU2ZdFnB8ma8Iy_AcSWU-w.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: Pedersen cryptography (commitment scheme cryptographic primitive)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryptographic Security is usually measured in binary bits, which may refer to the length of a key and/or the range of possible numbers that the key was randomly chosen from (i.e. a 128-bit binary number chosen from a range of 2¹²⁸ possible 128-bit numbers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Opinion: Any Psudeo-Random Number Generator is only as secure the various entropy inputs it gathers from various input sources, each time the generator runs (such as is outlined in the W3C Crypto API referenced in this post).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryptographically secure processes imply that the underlying primitives and method of construction of the processes used by an application has ideally been widely tested and relied upon as an industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;style&gt;body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GG18 threshold ECDSA just got real, KZen style! run it in your network with any parameters.

Cryptocurrency wallets that implement this process to create human-readable keys (mnemonic words), will usually result in 256-bits of security in the resulting 24–words (or 128 bits for 12-word key phrases), excluding the checksum bits which are deterministic (hash-derived).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c6jT0x-59wcUe_mqakCGrQ.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Breaking modern cryptographic primitives 🔨 💔&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the cryptographically secure processes we’ve discussed could (and likely may) be broken in the future, for the present moment they are believed to remain safe enough. These primitives are tested by and depended upon by the cybersecurity community for a reasonable amount of time (i.e. the next few years or until they are expected to no longer be secure), given the number of known theoretical attack vectors that are feasible. It’s a race against time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Blp7zaNQbM-ASPlM" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any such security assumption means the attack vectors that are infeasible are valid risks that just have an extraordinarily low probability such that they are considered near impossible/improbable. In other words, given the available technology and resources that an attacker or group could access, if it would take 1 million years to guess a password of with n bits of security, that becomes a negligible risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;🔜 Post-Quantum Algorithms 🚧 📐&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers could potentially crack such a password (see &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem"&gt;Polynomial versus Non-deterministic Polynomial time&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/108319a4c14d"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) perhaps in minutes or days, turning the risk into a non-negligible one that would no longer provide the security needed to remain cryptographically secure and require immediate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new suite of Quantum-resistant algorithms has been proposed as part of a second-round selection following submissions to the &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-2-submissions"&gt;National Institute of Standards (NIST)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These forward-thinking preparations enable the worldwide web including major standard’s bodies to have enough time to transition to the next-generation of encryption algorithms when the time is right (ideally long before the currently used ones are broken, and using the &lt;a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1075"&gt;Mosca Theorem&lt;/a&gt; to estimate how long).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reality check&lt;/strong&gt;: Reseachers who were funded by grants from the US, Switzerland and Russia, recently announced a paper &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/195238.php?from=423275"&gt;proving the ability to reverse time or reverse-enginner data&lt;/a&gt; (rewind states) through the use of a quantum computer program design, as seen in the excerpt below.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_3XeP0S2nl7l0iB-k6LUqA.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These next-generation technologies will be the building blocks for cybersecurity tools which go through rigorous testing by academics and governments globally before being widely adopted and incorporated into standards for everyday use by the masses. 🔮&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Cybersecurity tools remain complex 🔠 🔣 🔢&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running a primitive cryptographic application manually (i.e. hash functions, or encryption and decryption algorithms) remains a highly technical process even for sophisticated users, often requiring programming-like skills such as running code on a command-line level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a snapshot of what the hash value is for an empty string (“”), using three hash different algorithms separately in Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/768/1*hvT94kvSBBEdkAMRWTHing.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: BCAVentures.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many powerful cryptographic primitives help secure the internet protocols that run the web but are unavailable to the masses in “easy form”, forcing them to trust related third-party services who implement such services — behind the scenes — on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more advanced software such as Kali Linux can cause numerous problems and harm if used incorrectly (i.e. accidentally DDoS’ing your own website and getting your IP blacklisted from your own provider) and is an example of the type of tools that hackers use offensively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the same tools are also used by security researchers and hired white-hat hackers for defensive purposes to audit software and look for vulnerabilities to patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*FD7UyU7I2hkhI56z" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Automation happening behind the scenes 🎪&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope by now this picture is becoming more vivid, in terms of the processes that you could imagine are happening behind the scenes by software, even during normal processes such as sending an email or uploading a file to an encrypted service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many third parties eventually succumb to some type of 📁 data breach or mishandling of consumer data, this, in turn, can cause financial and physical harm to consumers. Whether sensitive personal data and privacy are part of a breach, if there is direct potential financial harm such as loss of property or funds, such breaches could even result in the loss of human life in the worst cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below we will look at some solutions to begin to chip away at solving these problems, with the help of open-source software and open systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*NyYkKB9hQsTjz0r9" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open-source provides Transparency first and foremost 🔍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main aspect of open-source is not whether the software is free or not, but whether the underlying language and architecture are visible for its users to examine and potentially vet the source-code in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare this open structure to closed-source technology which is based on blind-trust when it comes to any underlying code which remains hidden to all except its creators/owners, and you can see there are pros/cons to each approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*6ptNRnQetvoti4QG" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The range of open-source licenses ©️ ©️ ®️ ™️ 🚫&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though there are different types of &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/licensing-a-repository"&gt;open-source licenses&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/licensing-a-repository"&gt;choosealicense.com&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/8df3bf3c40ae"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;), ranging from less restrictive and more open, to more restrictive and less open, at the end they are all open in terms of visibility of the code (which is what matters in the context of this article).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open-source public repositories such as code found on sites such as Github invite collaboration as the public can inspect and contribute corrections, improvements and other feedback that can help drive the development process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux has evolved as an open-source operating system where some of its branches (distributions) are vibrant and widely used, while other branches died off due to lack of support/adoption. Below is an example of how open-source can evolve, as seen in this treemap of Linux distributions over time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BR_6bRLgAFPNMQDOBWiosQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;source: NPU on Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other licenses that have yet to be accepted by the &lt;a href="https://opensource.org/"&gt;Open Source Initiative (OSI)&lt;/a&gt; standard’s body that deals with the official “open-source” designation are still open-source in my opinion. For me open means the full visibility of the source code, even if the secondary benefits of sharing and use are restricted, such as &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/db5cd12199bd"&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;’s newest &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mongodb-open-source-server-side-public-license-rejected/"&gt;Server-Side Public License (SSPL)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cybersecurity risks with open-source software 🎯 👜&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While open-source software can be just as susceptible to security breaches as closed-source or mixed-source software is, making the code fully open allows for transparency to proper due diligence to be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent analysis found that many &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/over-100000-github-repos-have-leaked-api-or-cryptographic-keys/"&gt;open-source projects have leaked their cryptographic key data&lt;/a&gt;, which shows that best-practices are needed to secure authentication data (i.e. a path to the user&amp;#39;s SSH key referenced, as opposed to referencing the actual secret key in the hosted file).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eq4oGQn-gqIyYKIY" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefox recently launched its &lt;a href="https://send.firefox.com/"&gt;Firefox Send web app&lt;/a&gt;, which enables a user to send an encrypted file to anyone else via the use of a link, where the link acts as the key to decrypt the file, along with the ability for links to expire and be made available to one or more recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End to End encryption, from 3rd party services 🏪&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services that use end-to-end encryption might even be illegal in certain countries (like in &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-46463029"&gt;Australia which just passed new encryption laws &lt;/a&gt;last year, unless certain backdoors are implemented which inherently reduce the security properties such service try to aim to offer in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other countries are funding the development of end-to-end encrypted service, with the European Commission recently awarding a grant of over 1m euro to Swiss-based provider Proton Mail ✉️ to help fund its bug-bounty 🐛offering to crowdsource development of its open-source components (i.e. pay developers who help improve its code and find/fix bugs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;style&gt;body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congrats &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ProtonMail" target="_blank" title="Twitter profile for @ProtonMail"&gt;@ProtonMail&lt;/a&gt; on the €2m funding from the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/EU_Commission" target="_blank" title="Twitter profile for @EU_Commission"&gt;@EU_Commission&lt;/a&gt;!

This is a term (and formula) also used in computer science that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)"&gt;Claude Shannon&lt;/a&gt; borrowed from Boltzmann’s equation for entropy in physics, as it shared a similar structure for calculating the strength of a random string, hence entropy applies to information theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Pro Tip: You can calculate the entropy of a random password generated by calculating the log2(possible combinations) (i.e. log2(PasswordLibrary^PasswordLength) = overall entropy in bits.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entropy Formula:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log2(Possible combinations)= &lt;strong&gt;overall password entropy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RangeofPossibleCharacters^LengthofPassword=&lt;strong&gt;Possible combinations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log2(RangeofPossibleCharacters) = &lt;strong&gt;Entropy per character&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Entropy per character * LengthofPassword = overall password entropy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dGCBp5hj0zeBse-x" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason there is no such thing as perfect security is because of time, since as time passes, new methods of penetrating security arise because security is a process, not a destination. This is also why key sizes continue to increase as even more entropy is needed. In the words of many famous cryptographers and cybersecurity thought-leaders, let us ponder those words again, “security is a process, not a destination”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[…security is a process, not a destination.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing security to hacking old video games 🎮 👾&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analogy I like to compare when I think of how time changes our approach to a given technology is that over 20 years ago. For example, some Nintendo games were very very difficult to beat back in the early 80’s and 90s, and inspired a generation of gamers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, nowadays gamers stream at conferences such as GDQ (Games Done Quick) where they use the most creative methods to hack the game control commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0EHnXJEzx8bVHJtu" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These hacks are possible thanks to their ingenious approaches to reverse engineering how the random number generators work in the games, along with how screen state is recorded (such as with things like ‘frames per second’ for a given pixel area).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was mind blown when I first saw these game hacking ninjas in action, like beating the game in under 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;So what does this have to do with cybersecurity? Read on please.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*td3pqyRWui8AA4uCKZW5bA.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original game designer probably did not expect users to be able to exploit these hacks, but time and lots of trial-and-error are what helped lead the world record win in Super Mario Brothers on the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any Millennial or other age groups who played NES, the following video shows how far we’ve come thanks to time and gamers determined to hack these games using novel and creative methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F_FQJEzJ_cQw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_FQJEzJ_cQw&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F_FQJEzJ_cQw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/978b5ef246c6219a0679d0f68b1b8367/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/978b5ef246c6219a0679d0f68b1b8367/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h4&gt;It’s a real game&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting oneself online is becoming like a complex game, that is real, and where users need to hack (learn) and simplify so they can win and protect their data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like the argument where &lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin users hope to be sovereign over their own money&lt;/strong&gt; (with a bearer instrument that is resistant to censorship and unforgeable), &lt;strong&gt;users need to learn to be sovereign over their own data first &lt;/strong&gt;— or risk losing the private keys that control their digital money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ISSsRMjj5tQH4GnT" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning how to be sovereign over your own data 💪&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are plenty of tools on the dark web that can be used for offensive purposes (i.e. &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/"&gt;Kali Linux&lt;/a&gt;), including illegal applications that can cause financial harm or other irreparable damage, there exists an opposite force to counter these threats in the form of many open-source cybersecurity tools that can be used by consumers to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📝 There are also good tips and resources from &lt;a href="https://staysafeonline.org"&gt;Staysafeonline.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StaySafeOnline"&gt;https://twitter.com/StaySafeOnline&lt;/a&gt; run by The National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) a non-profit, and the &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/CISA"&gt;Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&lt;/a&gt;, a sub-division of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 🇺🇸.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)&lt;/a&gt; is another great resource 🏆 and major voice 📢 that helps advocate for protecting consumers rights on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve used some of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/2fa7aa79cd7a"&gt;Electronic Frontier Found&lt;/a&gt;ation’s browser-plugins from time to time, including &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger"&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere"&gt;HTTPS Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;, which are great tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the permissions these applications require means that you still have to trust them as third parties with your data (i.e. trust a 3rd party to protect you against other 3rd parties).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Dependencies that have dependencies 👽&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This same ‘trust’ dilemma exists in source code when it comes to third-party dependencies that developers rely on, and the dependencies of those dependencies. Below is an example of vulnerabilities detected in NPM a popular JavaScript programming library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8MfS3dctbt5oBKfaOVWkdQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Moderate vulnerability being detected after running NPM, patched in version 2.3.1&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Evolving Standards on the Web&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Standards Organization (ISO) which is working on a few related cryptography standards (i.e. The 27000 series) including for blockchain and cybersecurity, and there is ISOC, ISACA, COBIT and the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T), and the Center for Internet Security (CIS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other institutions such as the &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#RandomSource-method-getRandomValues"&gt;WorldWide Web Consortium (W3C) have a cryptography API&lt;/a&gt; (note: I am a contributor on Github to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/w3c/webcrypto"&gt;W3C Crypto repository&lt;/a&gt; 🤓).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5SVXxty9ZAkhj8wY" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trusted commands such as `getRandomValues`(which is the equivalent of using the `secrets` library in Python or the `Dev(Random)` command on Linux terminal) is depended on by countless internet applications to source secure-enough entropy (i.e. entropy that pre-image resistant) to seed a pseudo-random number generator that is cryptographically secure in terms of bits (i.e. 256-bit numbers). 🙀&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These technicalities could put the average consumer to sleep 😴 💤, but one need not understand the inner workings of hash functions (unless curious, or pursuing higher education) but rather how they tie into the bigger cybersecurity picture. 🖼&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, lots of people trust that these processes are cryptographically-secure because if someone could feasibly re-create that entropy (pre-image) that would break the security assumptions and put users data at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7Wiy3FScjNz0tAky" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Trust cannot yet be eliminated from software&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some degree of Trust is required at all levels, and that unit of trust becomes a commodity that is often squandered on the internet by users who give out too much of it and too freely (and then fall victim to breaches).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until we [perhaps] have a trustless internet one day, with trustless applications, there are still huge opportunities now for consumers to minimize the amount of trust they are forced to have/accept, and to reduce the risks and attack surface of their digital footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Here are examples:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;☑️ Learn &lt;strong&gt;how to use cryptographic primitives&lt;/strong&gt; (encryption algorithms &amp;amp; hash functions)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;☑️ &lt;strong&gt;Generate random cryptographically-secure passwords&lt;/strong&gt; of various lengths/strength&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;☑️ Opt for simpler tools where &lt;strong&gt;the entire code can be inspected&lt;/strong&gt; in a single file&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;☑️ ️Learn to use devices in &lt;strong&gt;cold storage environments&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. old laptop with wifi disabled) 📴&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Practice, practice, practice..makes things easier&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to shift the discussion towards the light web and how consumers will potentially behave in a world where self-reliance becomes as a necessity to protect oneself online, as more and more data breaches continue and trust in third-parties is eroded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⚡️ ⚡️⚡️ I host a few such open-source cybersecurity tools like the &lt;a href="https://bcaventures.com/AES.tool"&gt;Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)&lt;/a&gt; algorithm, available as a tool that can be used manually.⚡️⚡️⚡️&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1FewwfyDj346f6lBExtmHg.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: https://bcaventures.com/AES.html&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;⚡️ &lt;strong&gt;AES&lt;/strong&gt; is an encryption algorithm (often using 128-bit or 256-bit keys) that is widely used on the internet behind the scenes in automated services that consumers trust every day.⚡️&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the average user has probably never run AES manually as it otherwise remains complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The version of the tool I host works on a standalone basis even when not connected to the internet and allows users to encrypt and decrypt their data locally and securely (if used properly and with plugins disabled and in an offline environment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this version of the AES app I host is that all of the code is contained in one file, like other standalone tools. This file can be inspected by a user more easily than a typical application that contains numerous (perhaps dozens or hundreds) of source code files and folders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MiC5CLd_AQy3Hy_s" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Other advanced tools for learning/experiments and real usage&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another such tool we host on BCAVentures.com is the &lt;a href="https://bcaventures.com/shamir-secret-sharing-tool.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can be seen below where the secret string “This whole sentence is an example of a secret pasted into this tool.” becomes encrypted into 3 shares (ciphertext/keys) where at least 2 of the 3 shares are needed to reconstruct (decrypt) back to the original plaintext secret message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h7SHt-Ds2OvagSUjCi3oTQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: BCAventures.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shamir Secret Sharing tool allows a plain text secret (i.e. personal document, password, or other personal/private data to back up) to be encrypted into a chosen number of shares where a minimum number of those shares are needed to decrypt back to the original data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the screenshot above, a 2-of-3 ratio is chosen, where each of the five shares becomes the ciphertext/encrypted data, but are also part of the secret key/password needed to decrypt/unlock the data(when at least two of the three are combined and pasted into the tool).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of pasting at least two of the three shares back into the ‘combine’ field where the original secret is revealed just below in dark shaded text that is highlighted:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*woPepa00HxPvlTpCkzpM8Q.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: BCAVentures.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many of these tools remain too difficult for the average user, I expect that will change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers are being compelled to become more self-reliant, as the value of their data increases along with the increasing risks we face and new changing threat landscape on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nKe3hjciTlUzs1uW" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced cybersecurity tools (including open public blockchain networks) that allow time-stamping to prove provenance or verify that a particular document existed at some point in time, is another use case (such as for a legal agreement or will, etc..).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hashing a document where the hash of the document is recorded publicly as a digital fingerprint, will help not only empower users but echelon in a new paradigm of services and solutions from next-generation companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0tG7yc4p6kYLWY6n" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is still early as the average user doesn’t know how to hash a file unless using a 3rd party services, which is why I believe it is best to learn to do it from the command line yourself while looking at the source code to see what is “under the hood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Something as simple as having a spell checker plugin enabled can introduce risks for data to leak, which is why these tools are designed to work offline on a standalone basis, ideally in a cold environment (air-gapped).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Wow moment, we are almost there 🔜&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to help empower users with such tools like through efforts that BCA Ventures is pursuing, by wrapping open-source applications within an easy to access platform, that will “wow” them with powerful cybersecurity tools (not there yet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a free ‘wow’ in the meantime:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aDjUa2rRU0vde55jIUOB6A.gif" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;source: medium.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you liked this article and its purpose, &lt;strong&gt;please give it one or many claps 👏&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Economic growth among Arab countries is expected to be 3% this year and 3.5% in 2020, according to the director general of Arab Monetary Fund, Dr Abdul Rahman Al Hamidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arab countries traded what amounted to $585 bn between themselves without the recourse to any fintech-facilitating tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arab Regional Payment System (ARPS) that Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) and the UAE Central Bank (UAECB) piloted in January 2019 aims at expanding intra-Arab trade and investment activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crypto-based system through the use of blockchain technology named ABER ffavoursArab currency for cross-border payments among 22 member countries and has the added-value of cutting the cost and duration of remittances and payments between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The project is in the final stages and we are close to finalising the articles of establishment like building the system for smooth transactions. We will soon release the date when the actual transactions will start,” said Al Hamidy last Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment involves putting an initial capital of $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arab business deals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total value of economic and financial transactions among Arab nations is estimated to have reached up to $830 billion per year, of which $245 billion is attributed to intra-Arab trade in 2018, according to estimates by the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF), Al Hamidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ARPS will also foster the economic, trade, and investment relations with the region’s main trade partners from all parts of the world, considering that trade between the Arab region and the global economy amounted to roughly $1,960 billion in 2018, which equates to 5% of total global trade,” Al-Hamidy added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fintech such as blockchain enhance the efficiency of payments and create new opportunities such as access to remittances amounting to billions of dollars, not only among expats living in Arab countries but also Arab expats living abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zawya said that a recent KPMG report revealed global funding in financial technology increased by 120% in 2018 to $111.8 billion up from $50.8 billion in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief executive of Bahrain Fintech Bay told Zawya earlier this month that Middle East fintech investments make up just 1% of the global total, but he added that cross-border collaboration could significantly boost the industry’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;br&gt;Over the next few weeks, MEDICI brings you a series of articles exploring FinTech in the ASEAN region. The articles, each focused on a different ASEAN country, provide comprehensive insights into the FinTech investment landscape in the region. ASEAN in Figures ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is the third-largest Asian region. It is home to more than 630 million people and one-fourth of the population lives in urban areas. ASEAN has an annual growth rate of 4.7% and USD 119.97 billion in FDIs; it is also one of the fastest-growing regions as well as the seventh-largest economy globally. Its population is young and educated with a literacy rate of over 80%, phone-savvy with more than 0.5 phones per person, and enjoys a low-to-mid unemployment rate of 0.5%–6.9%.

&lt;div&gt;The Minister of Transportation and Telecommunications, Kamal bin Ahmed Mohammed has announced that preparations for the rollout of 5G networks in the Kingdom of Bahrain are complete and anticipates that Bahrain will be one of the first countries globally to provide commercial 5G services by June 2019, pending availability of consumer handsets and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the regulatory hurdles to full 5G implementation have been resolved, with the licensing and spectrum allocation set to be finalised by mid-April by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). Mobile operators in the Kingdom have already begun rolling out the necessary network infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bahrain’s state of readiness is a testament to the leadership of the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain in enabling the implementation of cutting-edge technology and promoting innovation, and the continuous support of all stakeholders including the TRA and the national Spectrum Strategy &amp;amp; Coordination Committee (SSCC), all of which serves to highlight the Kingdom’s continued role as a regional leader in telecommunications and ICT,” said the Minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This announcement positions Bahrain as one of the globe’s leading 5G-ready countries and increases its attractiveness as a destination for companies trialling next-generation technologies such as autonomous vehicles and virtual/augmented reality products as the Kingdom continues to encourage investment in world-class telecommunications infrastructure and services. These products and services will also be ably supported by the National Broadband Network (NBN) which will offer ubiquitous high-speed fibre-based products to operators and consumers throughout the Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful commercial trials for 5G technology in the Kingdom of Bahrain were held in June 2018 and all the operators are preparing to provide commercial 5G services which will be ready to go when consumer handsets become available. The products and services will be in line with the 3GPP standards issued in 2018 and will predominantly utilise bandwidth in the C-Band spectrum (3GHz) and will allow Bahraini companies to tap into the global 5G services market, which is anticipated to grow from an estimated 60 billion USD in 2020 to an estimated 125 billion USD in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingdom of Bahrain has consistently ranked high in global ICT indices, being ranked first in the Arab region in the ITU’s ICT Development Index (IDI) for the last five years, and ranked 4thglobally in the UN’s Telecommunications Infrastructure Index (TII) of the E-Government Development Index (EGDI) in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major benefit of 5G technology is enabling higher volume of data transmission at higher speeds (lower latencies). This in turn enables the development and implementation of technologies such as autonomous driving vehicles, which can require up to 100Gb of data per second to operate. Research and development into other technologies such as AI open up a massive potential market for Bahrain. Furthermore, 5G can potentially support interactive technologies like virtual reality which need high bandwidth to send and receive large amounts of data with very low latency, helping enable the growth of some IoT applications and delivering improved video streaming and high-end gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our leadership in 5G reflects Bahrain’s appetite for innovation and sends a signal to the world that we can be a test-bed for some of the most transformative technologies. There were a lot of hurdles along the way – ensuring spectrum availability as soon as possible was a big challenge, but overcoming these obstacles exemplifies the support and cooperation amongst all stakeholders in Bahrain and demonstrates how Bahrain can move quickly, deliver enormous progress against an accelerated timeframe, and be a partner to technology leaders,” said the Minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
