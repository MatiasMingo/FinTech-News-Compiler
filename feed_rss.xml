A staking mechanism usually encourages token holding against token trading, which in turn is expected to drive up the token valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="http://www.techhq.io"&gt;TechHQ&lt;/a&gt; we believe that knowledge exists to be shared, and in this article we are going to show how to implement a staking mechanism in solidity. The whole project including development environment and tests is available from &lt;a href="https://github.com/HQ20/StakingToken"&gt;our public github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build this staking mechanism we will need:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A staking token.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data structures to keep track of stakes, stakeholders and rewards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Methods to create and remove stakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rewards system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Staking Token&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A staking token can be created as an ERC20 token. I’m going to need SafeMath and Ownable later on, so let’s import and use those as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/7cac94e3a2951a24e94eb21c60e37d14/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/7cac94e3a2951a24e94eb21c60e37d14/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the code more readable I’m going to follow the function names from ERC20 and create equivalents to get the data from the stakes mapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/d7f48826b3b52ae20e9bf4e190ad3771/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/d7f48826b3b52ae20e9bf4e190ad3771/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;The methods implemented allow just to add a stakeholder, remove a stakeholder, and verify whether an address belongs to a stakeholder. Other more efficient implementations are surely possible but I like this one for readability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/de236062f5b33e4f0ab2f4f70c2dd610/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/de236062f5b33e4f0ab2f4f70c2dd610/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stakes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stake at its simplest form will need to record the &lt;em&gt;stake size&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;stake holder.&lt;/em&gt; A really simple implementation of this could be just a mapping from the address of the stakeholder to the stake size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/5a625d386c0201f667458c329199132b/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/5a625d386c0201f667458c329199132b/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the code more readable I’m going to follow the function names from ERC20 and create equivalents to get the data from the stakes mapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/fa26e1f9b5776b90ce085cdbbc371369/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/fa26e1f9b5776b90ce085cdbbc371369/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now going to give STK holders the capability to create and remove stakes. We will burn the tokens as they are staked to stop users from transferring them until the stake is removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that on stake creation _burn will revert if the user tries to stake more tokens than he owns, and on stake removal the update of the stakes mapping will revert if there is an attempt to remove more tokens that were staked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we use addStakeholder and removeStakeholder to have a record of who has stakes, to be used later in the rewards system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/131b1b04f406959cd27aaa17113e98d3/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/131b1b04f406959cd27aaa17113e98d3/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rewards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rewards mechanisms can have many different implementations and be quite heavy to run. For this contract we will implement a very simple version where the stakeholders periodically receive a reward in STK tokens equivalent to a 1% of their individual stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more sophisticated contracts the distribution of rewards would be automatically triggered when certain conditions are met, but in this case we will let the owner trigger it manually. Following best practice we will also keep track of the rewards and implement a method to withdraw them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As before, to make the code readable we have followed the naming conventions from the ERC20.sol contract, first the data structure and data management methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/820aef9972e7a18a6c8f350f4cacba52/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/820aef9972e7a18a6c8f350f4cacba52/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow the methods to calculate, distribute and withdraw rewards:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/8eaf82138fa220e799957f86717d6b61/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/8eaf82138fa220e799957f86717d6b61/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;No contract can be complete without a comprehensive set of tests. I tend to produce a bug per function at least, and often things don’t work the way I think they do. You could say I get things wrong most of the time, and surely I’m not alone in this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from allowing you to produce code that works, tests also are quite useful in developing a process to set up and use contracts. I always write my Getting Started documentation from the code that sets up the environment for the tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follows an extract of how the test environment is set up and used. We will mint 1000 STK tokens and give them to a user to play with the system. We use truffle for testing which gives us the accounts to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/7ec717cd41c86a819137827eabe15a49/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/7ec717cd41c86a819137827eabe15a49/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;When creating tests I always write the tests that make the code revert, but those are not very interesting to see. The test for createStake shows what needs to be done to create a stake, and what should change afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to notice how in this staking contract we have two parallel data structures, one for STK balances and one for stakes and how their sum remains constant through stake creation and removal. In this example we give 3 STK wei to the user, and the sum of balance plus stakes for that user will always be 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/d69ab1b1ff96e2ae0b2be64a4c3a27f2/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/d69ab1b1ff96e2ae0b2be64a4c3a27f2/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;For rewards, the test below shows how the owner fires up the distribution of fees, with the user getting a reward of a 1% of his stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/a8a0af577391b17ccc782b4a6ec4f6f4/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/a8a0af577391b17ccc782b4a6ec4f6f4/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total supply for STK is increased when rewards are distributed, and this test shows how the three data structures (balances, stakes and rewards) relate to each other. The amount of existing and promised STK will always be the amount minted on creation plus the amount distributed in rewards, which might or might not be minted. The amount of STK minted on creation will be equal to the sum of balances and stakes until a distribution is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/e88fac51c43290b8d70c0d895a8ebf09/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/e88fac51c43290b8d70c0d895a8ebf09/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A staking and rewards mechanism is a powerful incentive tool that only needs to be as complex as we want to make it. The methods provided in the ERC20 standard and SafeMath allows us to code it in about 200 lines of sparse code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to use the code in&lt;a href="https://github.com/HQ20/StakingToken"&gt; our public github&lt;/a&gt; for your own purposes, or to&lt;a href="https://www.techhq.io/#GetinTouch"&gt; contact us&lt;/a&gt; if you would like our help to implement a production version of this pattern.

Let’s take a moment to analyze and evaluate what the hell actually happened in the past 2 years and how it affected the investments market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some simple math, shall we? If a company had a softcap of $3,000,000 USD it would ‘&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;’ have taken 4,000 Ethereum back in January of 2018. Now fast forward to this day and the same company would require approximately 21,500 ETH to reach the same softcap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sure we all heard warnings before that crypto is too volatile and now we’ve lived to see it become reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fact people should know firsthand is that during Q1 2018, the average duration of fundraising campaigns went from 30days =&amp;gt; 2months!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1008/1*uOX1R5ivQKRSMq2fZn7Yhg.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correlation of Ethereum price in USD and the amount of successful (softcap reached) ICOs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at the graphic, we notice that the down-trending volatility was deadly. It is easy to talk in hindsight but the apparent mistake that startups made was not converting the acquired investment to USDT after each round of their respective sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public ICO sales starting to fail significantly from May of 2018 as a consequence of the overall market drop. They didn’t have the resources to keep up with their roadmaps, develop in time and were waiting for the market to stabilize before even thinking about exchange listings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This came at the cost of losing the trust of the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rise of a Security Token Offering rhetoric&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ICOs could no longer achieve their million dollar public sale targets and where missing those by substantial margins, investors began to search for high-return glory elsewhere. That’s when the term of &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/security-token-offerings-stos-what-you-need-to-know-8628574d11e2"&gt;Security Token Offerings&lt;/a&gt; or STOs came back in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crypto token that passes the &lt;a href="https://consumer.findlaw.com/securities-law/what-is-the-howey-test.html"&gt;Howey Test&lt;/a&gt; is deemed to be a security token. These usually derive their value from an external, tradeable asset. Because tokens are deemed securities, they are subject to federal securities laws and regulations which are strictly enforced by local and regional governments in order to keep markets balanced and protect retail investors from manipulation through the use of complex and convoluted financial instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STOs that have finished over the past half year are struggling to find an exchange capable and verified to list security tokens. A number of exchanges are currently looking towards becoming regulated in order to do so (i.e. The Gibraltar Stock Exchange, Coinbase, ZBX, etc…) while other exchanges are being built from the bottom up already proclaiming themselves to be security token exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hard truth is that at the moment no platform is 100% qualified to actually do it. As securities are protected by laws and regulations, so are the vendors which allow the exchange of such assets. And there are a number of jurisdiction issues that no one knows how to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CKHp1rQ1caSXeU8GWW8uqw.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine a case when an STO is performed by a company in Asia (1) with respective security issuance laws, the security token is listed on an exchange in the U.S. (2) which has to follow local regulations and the trader who wants to buy listed security tokens is from Europe (3) where there are also a different set of laws made to protect retail investors. It’s a real rabbit hole of chaos, wouldn’t you agree?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, the idea of an STO sounds very appealing, but the reality is that we’re far far away from actually creating an efficient market for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Exchange Offerings comes to the scene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we already mentioned before, investors are looking for alternatives when their investment isn’t brought to the trading market fast enough and &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/hottest-thing-in-crypto-right-now-what-is-initial-exchange-offering-ieo-948cc283ca92"&gt;Initial Exchange Offerings&lt;/a&gt; are exactly what they are looking for at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors don’t need to ask ‘when exchange’ as the public sale is being conducted through an exchange already&lt;em&gt;, the &lt;/em&gt;name itself is kind of suggestinve. Moreover, it helps to avoid a lot of negative pressure (FUD) and is perfect for maintaining the trust of the community and therefore the project!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects can host their private sale on their own accord. Through an IEO, the exchange takes care of the KYC procedures and the unlock of the tokens which in turn helps to save operational funds for the underlying project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Received funds are available for withdrawal 24/7 and can be used to do extensive marketing and be injected towards business development. To be honest, those activities should be the main focus after all while the IEO-hosting exchange can take care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IEO is on hype from which the project and the exchange can benefit from. Through cross-marketing promotion many doors open and the project as well as the exchange both grow in unison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every launchpad does extensive marketing support and guidance so it is very important to pick a vendor which is willing to stand-by and work as a team. Both successes become one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eE0eQz8PiqNZPLwW-_EvWw.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we have and what comes next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on data for 2018, a staggering 58% of ICOs did not manage to raise $100,000 and only 2% of all announced ICOs has been listed on exchange. It’s time to evolve and IEOs are immediately becoming super effective!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial Exchange Offerings are done through launchpads. Until &lt;a href="https://bitmax.io"&gt;Bitmax &lt;/a&gt;stepped forward there wasn’t really any traction for it. Bitmax performed perfectly for ANKR and FET while &lt;a href="https://launchpad.binance.com/"&gt;Binance was developing their launchpad&lt;/a&gt;. Now Binance does 1 IEO per month, in which you can only contribute with BNB (Binance’s native token). Binance IEOs get sold so fast that the the platform itself simply cannot process the contributions so fast. This transfors into frustration for the people who fail to contribute. Even more concerning is that only bot-fueled engines successfully manage to get the maximum amount of contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*pg9XkRCEd39sZK7JLwl69Q.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we see here on the left is the evidence of that. A bot was constantly pinging Binance to participate in CELER IEO until it succeeded and reached the maximum amount of contributions allowed. That is 6 times. So it’s not only that people are having trouble to get in on the action, but the launchpad discriminates in favor of automated algorithms… Doesn’t really sound like a decentralized solution, to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other exchanges who also have a launchpad and enjoy this publicity they get from it. However, if they don’t coordinate cross-promotion and marketing efforts properly, they struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A-F_fGPnPipGCnp_z1qa2A.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side, there is &lt;a href="http://www.exmarkets.com"&gt;ExMarkets&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.coinstruction.com"&gt;family member CoinStruction’s liquidity framework&lt;/a&gt;, which is growing at a rapid pace. Not only marketing wise they deliver successful and amusing results but are also bringing us the next step in contributing to an IEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://exmarkets.com/launchpad"&gt;ExMarkets launchpad&lt;/a&gt; brings you an opportunity to attract fiat (euro) contributions. The older generation of hodlers prefer not to invest their ETH but are more open to doing a simple fiat investment directly through the launchpad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gets even better as the big step for non-crypto people to invest in a project became a lot shorter. Fiat — Token pair. Definitely worth to keep an eye out on this exchange as they are taking the lead in innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Disclaimer: This article has been co-written with the help of my good friend &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christof-waton-6b9144166/"&gt;Christof Waton&lt;/a&gt; also known as Cryptowaton in the cryptocurrency space.

&lt;div&gt;Words by: Fadi Nwilati, CEO, Kaizen Asset Management Services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Chatbots are changing the way that businesses handle customer service issues. In recent years, chatbot technology has been implemented across a number of popular platforms including Facebook Messenger and Skype. You may have even interacted with a chatbot without even being aware of it. In the real estate industry, chatbots are impacting the way we buy, sell and rent properties, but most noticeably, they are changing the way sellers interact with the end-user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the launch of AI-powered chatbots from Facebook, Microsoft, and Google in 2016, the technology began to be implemented rapidly in customer-facing businesses. Already the technology has seen a great deal of success in industries like healthcare and e-commerce, raising the ROI on customer engagement significantly. As chatbot and AI technology progress, businesses are leveraging this emerging technology to enhance their customer services. There are a wealth of queries, particularly in the real estate industry, that is repetitive and do not require human engagement. Here are five reasons why you should welcome chatbot technology into your real estate business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always-on support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chatbots don’t sleep! They don’t need holidays or take sick days. Having a chatbot to address frequent queries means that your customer service is available 24/7, 365 days per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve customer satisfaction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers these days have incredibly high demands when it comes to response timing. You want to be able to answer your customers’ questions immediately, giving them instant gratification, and reducing stress on both sides. Getting stuck in a phone loop, or having them wait days for a response will do nothing to support your user experience, and may reflect poorly on your business. Real estate chatbots can address frequently asked questions and common concerns immediately. They can process relevant data and perform calculations allowing them to provide support customized to your customers’ issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never overloaded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cyclical real estate market, there are times of the year where queries reach a high volume. For the industry that means longer man-hours and rising overhead costs. Chatbots can handle fluctuating loads without increasing labour or training costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seamless integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This next generation of customers expects their customer service to be as mobile as they are. From emails to social media and message reminders, companies need to meet the customer where they are and have a presence across platforms. Chatbots can help stitch these platforms together seamlessly to integrate the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid mistakes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chatbots take human error and limitations out of the equation. Whereas a human may forget, or calculate something incorrectly, chatbots simply will not. Chatbots have access to libraries of information and can improve their responses as customers interact with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chatbots can save time and money for stakeholders across the real estate industry ecosystem. With the ability to address thousands of enquiries, a single chatbot can keep overhead and labor costs down, while improving customer service. In the US, chatbots save USD $23 billion in the customer service industry, and the UAE is making strides to do the same. Customer service AI implementation in the UAE could mean big business for the real estate market. Traditional customer-facing roles will always be there, while chatbots can take care of some of the more tedious tasks so that you can take care of your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;br&gt;Over the next few weeks, MEDICI brings you a series of articles, exploring FinTech in the ASEAN region. The articles, each focused on a different ASEAN country, provide comprehensive insights into the FinTech investment landscape in the region. ASEAN in figures ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is the third-largest Asian region. It is home to more than 630 million people. One-fourth of the population lives in urban areas. ASEAN has an annual growth rate of 4.7% and USD 119.97 billion in FDIs; it is also one of the fastest-growing regions as well as the seventh-largest economy globally. Its population is young and educated with a literacy rate of over 80%, phone-savvy with more than 0.5 phones per person, and enjoys a low-to-mid unemployment rate of 0.5%–6.9%. ASEAN members also have an average to a high life expectancy of 69–82.7 years, and a gender parity of 49.9% males to...&lt;br/&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2019 13:36:00 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>finextra: Boerse Stuttgart and Axel Springer to create joint venture for digital asset trading -  Puntaje: 1000</title><link>https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/77809/boerse-stuttgart-and-axel-springer-to-create-joint-venture-for-digital-asset-trading?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=finextrafeed</link><description>Boerse Stuttgart Group and Axel Springer SE with its finanzen.net portal will be working together in...</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2019 10:35:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>AMEinfo: “2018 a record year for Bahrain, 2019 will be better” | WEF 2019 -  Puntaje: 1200</title><link>https://ameinfo.com/money/banking-finance/2018-a-record-year-for-bahrain-2019-will-be-better-wef-2019/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="150" height="150" src="https://ameinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-27-at-3.31.51-PM-min-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" srcset="https://ameinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-27-at-3.31.51-PM-min-150x150.png 150w, https://ameinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-27-at-3.31.51-PM-min-200x200.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The largest cloud computing provider in the world Amazon Web Services decided to open three data centers in Bahrain earlier this year with a focus on digital transformation. Simon Galpin, Managing Director at the Bahrain Economic Development Board, spoke exclusively to AMEinfo on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland about Bahrain's digital drive, its aim to boost the startup ecosystem, to upscale its image as a fintech hub and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the beauties of being a relatively small economy is that you can be quite nimble. By adopting a Team Bahrain approach, we can bring together all the major decision-makers and introduce new regulations, new laws very quickly. So we've updated and upgraded our bankruptcy law ... we've introduced a data protection law and it's the first of its kind in the Middle East," said Simon Galpin at WEF 2019 in Davos.&lt;/p&gt;

Search across your tagged tweets and private notes from a single dashboard&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zdqYrBNCX2L_SZ9DlMYnFQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Twitter adds bookmarks features&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter recently added the option to bookmark your tweets. This was a great feature I was looking out for. These days I use twitter for keeping myself up-to-date about the latest happenings in tech and product world. Whenever I come across a tweet that might come handy later I used to add it to bookmarks. If you have not used this feature do check it out. The feature is enabled by default on the app. If you want to do the same on the desktop version you need to &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/usehighlights"&gt;visit the mobile version. &lt;/a&gt;Looks like twitter is moving toward this new interface in an experimental mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/usehighlights"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RCf-xfROTAy84bzqdMF0qg.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Add bookmarks from desktop&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also view all your bookmarks from the &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/i/bookmarks"&gt;bookmarks link.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/i/bookmarks"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yOCKtXz7ystn0hLop5aLtw.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bookmarks listing page&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;I want more !!!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this was good I always felt like I wanted more. Two things that I wanted most were ability to tag the tweets and add private notes. As I mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@gokulnk/declaration-of-intent-2018-f222ce76b6c8"&gt;Declaration of Intent&lt;/a&gt; I am dedicating my time and energy in the following topics only : Javascript, Linux, React, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. So most of my reading is also centred around this. So I naturally felt like tagging my tweets across these categories. This was something I really wanted. Looking at the pace twitter is implementing this I felt that they might take at-least an year or more to implement these features. So I started using our own chrome extension for categorising that tweets that mattered to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Introducing Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlights is a chrome extension that helps you highlight as you read across the web. We have been working on this for the last couple of months. Using this extension in addition to making highlights you can also tag content and add private notes. Considering that &lt;strong&gt;“Add to bookmarks” &lt;/strong&gt;we thought of integrating twitter bookmarks into our application. But sadly twitter API doesn’t expose user’s bookmarks at all. That was a bummer. Considering how big @twitter is we had almost taken this for granted. But looks like twitter doesn’t like to share too much of data. Looks like they are making sure that other interfaces/applications don’t compete with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;It works across the web&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily since our extension works across the web as long a unique content has a unique url I was able to use our extension in my flow without too many changes. So whenever I see a relevant or important tweet, I just click on the timestamp to get the unique url of the content. Then I use our extension to highlight, tag or add private notes. For example I got a notification about this tweet and wanted to reply to it from official handle &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/usehighlights"&gt;https://twitter.com/usehighlights&lt;/a&gt; Since I didn’t want to miss the flow(writing this post) I just highlighted the relevant text, added private notes to it and tagged it based on how I would search for this particular tweet later. I can always revisit later and tweet when I have time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QgxkbGufbl1S5zy8ZPeyTA.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I am done with saving it, I can always search for this tweet and its context from our search dashboard. All I had to do was run a search like &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.learningpaths.io/#/highlights?search=&amp;amp;tag:twitter"&gt;https://alpha.app.learningpaths.io/#/highlights?search=&amp;amp;tag:twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy4Lduu9CKg&amp;amp;t=2324s"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nZEl5bbCgcaVGg1AFX6b4g.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why is twitter blocking user access to their own content?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally we were thinking of just integrating with twitter’s flow so that users can just use the normal flow for bookmarking tweets and then we could pull these bookmarked tweets into our dashboard. It would have been a much smoother flow provided twitter gave access to the API. Looking at &lt;a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/api-for-new-bookmarks/102091"&gt;twitter staff response&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://trello.com/b/myf7rKwV/twitter-developer-platform-roadmap"&gt;twitter API roadmap&lt;/a&gt; it appeared like they were not even keen on making this API available in the future. This was a bummer but it reiterated our faith in the product that we are building. We strongly feel that &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@gokulnk/draft-url-is-at-the-centre-of-open-web-2c79ad88ab18"&gt;URL is the centre of the open web&lt;/a&gt; and users should have access to their data. Especially the stalwarts of internet like Facebook and twitter shouldn’t stifle users access to their own data by limiting their APIs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts? We would like to hear your thoughts about using Twitter’s bookmarks flow, does our extension really solve the problem for you and if we can do anything more to improve your experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8478baf6eacc" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/tag-your-tweets-and-add-private-notes-8478baf6eacc"&gt;Tag your tweets and add private notes&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2019 12:34:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Blockchain News: Quedex on Brink of Becoming World’s First Regulated Crypto-Centric Futures and Options Exchange, after in-principle Decision from GFSC -  Puntaje: 3700</title><link>https://www.the-blockchain.com/2019/03/27/quedex-on-brink-of-becoming-worlds-first-regulated-crypto-centric-futures-and-options-exchange-after-in-principle-decision-from-gfsc/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.the-blockchain.com/2019/03/27/quedex-on-brink-of-becoming-worlds-first-regulated-crypto-centric-futures-and-options-exchange-after-in-principle-decision-from-gfsc/"&gt;Quedex on Brink of Becoming World&amp;#8217;s First Regulated Crypto-Centric Futures and Options Exchange, after in-principle Decision from GFSC&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.the-blockchain.com/author/wieke/"&gt;Wieke Beenen&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.the-blockchain.com"&gt;Blockchain News - Security and Utility Tokens, Tokenomics, Cryptoeconomics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
