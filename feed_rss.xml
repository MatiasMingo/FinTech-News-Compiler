He who offers it cheaper and faster leverages on its own efficiency to overcome its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge of decentralized technologies have done just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever there is a tight turn, whoever is on the road may either slow down to keep on a regulated drive or opt out for a faster way by cutting the corner of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illusion of a long straight line disarmed traditional industries, namely finance, rather incompetent, unprepared and disbelieving in recent developments, as if the democratization of access to money and its management was something of a fad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qqziTjX4ZOFo9RdrttmOvA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, cutting corners of a road does not exactly mean to win a race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why blindly adapting to DLTs may just be a fiasco&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fintech companies surged, barriers seemed to be of bureaucracy rather than technological. It was not a matter of means to offer more competitive financial services, but of access to the industry. That was an accurate impression, but not an ever lasting one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore’s law taught us that technology disruption doubles its speed each time it happens. Intervals between mainstream adoption of new tech and new ones rendering it useless get shorter every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just so, but this time around, it seems like even before the mainstream adoption of DLTs its next-gen is already in the shadow. That is quantum computing. While it is not expected that quantum capabilities will develop anytime soon to squander DLTs as they are structured today, they may be impactful not too long after the industry readapted their business models to DLTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the reason why it is useful to quantum-proof DLTs, because:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i) These may just be surviving all the others using permeable protocols at some point in time; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ii) The adoption and rearrangement of businesses to DLTs will have the industry incur in costs which may not have time to pay themselves out before quantum technology puts the integrity of the structure of DLTs in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A summary of the script for your new favorite technology flop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the most sizeable fintech companies operating at the moment are not blockchain-based — meaning that these companies cut the first corner without recourse to especially disruptive technologies — the next turns ahead along the road are expected to require a grip onto more challenging means of provision of financial services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are that this is the use case for DLTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that while it is expected that the trend for decentralization will push for solutions that DLTs are able to respond to, it is also not an especially difficult exercise of futurology to predict that industry players introducing DLTs to their business models will need it to be sufficiently responsive to their business in terms of speed, volume and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kicker is that DLTs &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44"&gt;just can’t&lt;/a&gt;. New surging technologies have inconveniences, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2ZmO1dU3WCt3mKCvTmW25w.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been vastly written on how difficult it seems to get the use of blockchain to scale, given the data processing power that it requires to build a public and functional ever-growing omniscient registry of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, as an outright evidence of these difficulties, &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/alternative-blockchain-consensus-mechanisms-40c1509af39e"&gt;the search for alternatives to the purest consensus mechanism&lt;/a&gt;, in order to increase cost and energy efficiencies at the cost — at least in theory — of security and close to perfect tamper-proof conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream adoption will pressure the technology for faster and more efficient inputs to the industry and structural purity will most likely be replaced with structural promptness for a quick response to commercial queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally it may just be that a different technology arises in the midst of a blockchain security-panic: quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is as troubling as it is an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A layman’s briefing on how quantum ability is able to render 1.0 DLTs obsolete&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology, while incredibly complex in detail, is quite simple in its structural design for success. It relies on asymmetric encryption which right now is virtually impossible to tamper using modern day computation power and without raising any flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impenetrable soundness of blockchain defense mechanisms relies on the fact that contemporary computing processes data in bits, as in 0s and 1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, immunity is not everlasting, if we take into consideration how quantum computing works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, quantum computing, because it operates in qubits — as in 0s, 1s and their superposition — is able to process data in a unseemingly faster and more efficient manner and capable of factoring sufficiently large numbers to tamper DLTs encryption methods, &lt;a href="https://codeburst.io/quantum-threat-to-blockchains-shors-and-grover-s-algorithms-9b01941bed01"&gt;in theory both the asymmetric encryption and hashing encryption using different algorithms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banks were unprepared for DLTs but will they be prepared to cut the next corner?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective suggests that the provision of blockchain-based financial services — the DLT’ed fintech — will follow the provision of financial services as offered at the moment — primal fintech — but will sit prior to a quantum-proof or quantum-fueled blockchain-based provision of financial services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At dawn of 2019 quantum development faces quite big obstacles and R&amp;amp;D is slow-moving, but — to be confirmed that tension between quantum and DLTs is real — a few points are worth of mention as opportunity arises:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i) Developments in quantum computing may render basic DLTs useless but players may be unwilling to go the extra mile and blend the two technologies. In this case, it is expected that the need for safety and soundness in the industry will invert the trend onto centralization once again;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ii) In case quantum R&amp;amp;D goes further to quantum-proof as well as quantum-fuel DLTs, 1.0 versions of blockchain-based fintech services will lose space for newer, sounder, safer versions of the technology and win over previous ones; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iii) The price of parts for hardware of quantum computers is sickening as &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612760/quantum-computers-component-shortage/"&gt;the market is very much undersupplied&lt;/a&gt;. Not many companies offer nuclear byproducts, which means that R&amp;amp;D development is slower than it could be. Seizing predominance in the market of goods may be relevant to assure a position in the market of services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional players could just be in a position to take the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if unlikely for quantum computing to be able in a near-future to crack both asymmetric encryption and hashing encryption altogether, considering the very different possibilities of the three presented above, one thing is clear: your old bank’s best chance is to go quantum, otherwise they will just be running behind the train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5b1173f9402f" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/your-old-banks-best-chance-is-to-go-quantum-5b1173f9402f"&gt;Your old bank’s best chance is to go quantum&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 10:20:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hackernoon: Ethereum Falls Back to Earth.

The decline in Initial Coin Offerings’ popularity is one obvious factor, but of pertinence has been Ethereum’s proven inability to process transactions across its network in an efficient manner. In this post, I explore Ethereum transaction costs using data made available via Google Bigquery. This writeup assumes a basic understanding of the mechanics of proof-of-work blockchains (the core innovation upon which Ethereum and Bitcoin are based) and SQL. The ease with which one can track recent scalability inefficiencies across the Ethereum network offers a compelling test case in favor of blockchain’s promise of facilitating a more transparent economic sphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Big Picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the height of crypto mania in December 2017 and January of 2018, billions of dollars worth in Ether was being transmitted across the Ethereum network on a daily basis. During these months, the promise of an open financial system felt on the verge of coming to fruition. If bitcoin would take the mantle as a 21st century form of gold, the Ethereum Virtual Machine was poised to become a 21st century Federal Reserve — albeit independent of vested machinations. Indeed, rather than have our monetary policy be dictated behind closed doors, from here on in we would place our collective trust in a virtual machine whose source code had been made available for all to scrutinize and whose 24-year-old wunderkid founder engaged in public intellectual debates via his twitter handle @&lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/587a00dbce51"&gt;Vitalik Buterin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/434/1*pNx-qLrYSOXFQbE25ETHBg.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ethereum Captures the World’s Imagination. The Fed? Not so much.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the future of finance being tied to public blockchain, and with Ethereum the most robust of these platforms, numerous founders rushed to build financial products on the Ethereum virtual machine; MakerDAO successfully launched a stable coin, Compound received funding from a number of prominent investors to develop a decentralized money market, DyDx constructed a platform for decentralized derivatives, and 0x designed a protocol for peer-to-peer exchange of myriad assets. Moreover, new financial instruments looked plausible via Ethereum — tokenized real estate and art or prediction markets as in Augur and Gnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several months later, the picture for Ethereum and its associated ‘internet of value’ is starkly different. Though some distributed applications have gained traction amongst hacker types, few have managed to retain engagement from a broad user base. The dollar value of transactions transacted across the network has fallen to around $200 million daily on average in October 2018. Nonetheless, the upper limits of Ethereum’s throughput capacity are regularly tested. Ethereum’s proponents argue that this technology will be as foundational as the internet, but for such an outcome to be realized, the system needs to scale to handle millions, if not billions of complex transactions an hour. And scale it has not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethereum founder, Vitalik notes that distributed networks suffer from a trilemma: the security and decentralization of a system come at the cost of its scalability. As additional nodes are added to a PoW blockchain, so too does the amount of work required to process data across the entire ledger. To compensate the Ethereum network, a participant must pay cryptocurrency referred to as ‘gas’ for each transaction. During the early days of Ethereum these costs were negligible for participants, but as more numerous and complex computational tasks have been transmitted to the network, and as more nodes are added to the system, gas costs have similarly ascended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-O1q6d_TeXFJHn_wV1usTg.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick Your Favorite Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the PoW architecture renders the network more secure — more nodes reduce vulnerability to sybil attack — it does come at the sacrifice of efficiency. Whereas Visa can verify up to 56,000 transactions per second, Ethereum can handle roughly 15. Consequently, a proof-of-work based smart contract platform is ill-suited to process numerous computational tasks, and even worse suited to base an entire monetary system upon. If such a system cannot compete with the entrenched incumbents, it must evidently continue its downward fall to earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verifying Ethereum’s Scalability Issues with Queryable Blockchain Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we’ve established the conceptual dilemma facing distributed networks like Ethereum, let’s next verify that Ethereum indeed suffers from a scalability problems, by showing the data. Average daily gas costs provide a useful proxy to gauge scalability bottlenecks, and such costs can be derived from data contained within each Ethereum block. Public blockchain advocates purport that tracking transactions across the ledger is easy and transparent. This has historically been false. Until recently, monitoring transactions across the Ethereum network required firing up a complete node and deep technical expertise to boot. No longer. Having uploaded the entireties of the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquery-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics"&gt; onto its cloud platform,&lt;/a&gt; Google’s BigQuery allows us to easily track Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain data via SQL queries. Simply sign up for Google’s BigQuery via your Google Account. Next create a Sql instance and tie that to BiqQuery’s Ethereum dataset. BigQuery’s Ethereum dataset contains all relevant information since the Ethereum genesis block was launched, including each block’s timestamp, hash, parent hash, and all the transactions contained therein. With data being mapped to a traditional relational database structure, we can run a query like the one that follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;SELECT &lt;br&gt;  sum(transactions.value/POWER(10,18)) as value, AVG(gas_price*(receipt_gas_used/POWER(10,18))) AS avg_gas_cost, date( blocks.timestamp) as date&lt;br&gt;FROM &lt;br&gt;  `bigquery-public-data.ethereum_blockchain.transactions` AS transactions,&lt;br&gt;  `bigquery-public-data.ethereum_blockchain.blocks` AS blocks&lt;br&gt;WHERE TRUE&lt;br&gt;  AND transactions.block_number = blocks.number&lt;br&gt;  AND receipt_status = 1&lt;br&gt;  AND value &amp;gt; 0 &lt;br&gt;GROUP BY date &lt;br&gt;HAVING date &amp;gt;= &amp;#39;2017-10-16&amp;#39; AND date &amp;lt;= &amp;#39;2018-12-31&amp;#39;&lt;br&gt;ORDER BY date, value&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This query offers three outputs: dates in ascending order, the total amount transacted in Ethereum across the network on that date, and average Ethereum transaction cost denominated in Ether on the same day. From Google’s Biquery, one can export a csv file to Excel and multiply daily average transaction costs in Ether by daily average price of Ether to derive the average cost per Ethereum transaction on a given date in dollar terms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/705/1*IOVwfCcMVIlVvRGefjGDwg.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ethereum Hits a Bottleneck&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late December of 2017, Ethereum’s first hit dApp, Cryptokitties clogged the network [Some transaction went unconfirmed for hours on end, while costs of running simple contracts rose precipitously]. For a system intended as the bedrock of an open source ‘internet of value,’ that folks simply sending (adorable) digital cats over Christmas time could test the network’s throughput capacity served to undermine the promise of a distributed financial system. This wasn’t the first, or even the most dire crisis to confront the Ethereum ecosystem. In 2016, the DAO hack would result in a hard fork. Prior to the Dao Hack, smart contracts had not been battle-tested. The hack demonstrated a need for heightened security around smart contracts, the applications built on top of Ethereum. Suddenly, the need for safer, more scalable distributed ledgers became apparent to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, despite falling dollar costs of Ether, gas prices again spiked. This time around the culprit was a new feature launched by Chinese exchange, FCoin. Fcoin used poorly programmed smart contracts to allow participants to vote on new tokens to issue to its exchange. Ethereum clearly needs scalability solutions to update its platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Q_-CVany4DCmkT3fxCfamQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someone is salty..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best solution will safeguard public blockchain’s best features (i.e. security, transparency, and immutability) while eliminating those features that make it ill-suited for global commerce such as excessive energy consumption, poor user interface, and throughput concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The View from Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some predictions on the future of Ethereum and Public Blockchains going forward are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability and Security will be prioritized above Decentralization.&lt;/strong&gt; ‘Store of value’ cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Monero will maintain proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, but the leading smart contract platforms will need to transition to alternative consensus mechanisms. These protocols will place a higher barrier to entry on participating nodes, diminishing the decentralization of such systems. This is a good thing, as in reality PoW blockchains haven’t been truly decentralized since Bitcoin’s early days. Though all nodes must process transactions in a PoW system, in reality the same game-theoretic mechanisms that reduce the chance of a sybil attack in a PoW system are at play in PoS system (it minimizes token value and hence the payout for all nodes when a blockchain’s decentralization is jeopardized by a sybil attack;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02420.pdf"&gt; preventing dishonest behavior from ≥ 51% of the nodes of a distributed system is thus a cryptoasset’s nash-equilibrium)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Smart Contract Platforms will become market leaders.&lt;/strong&gt; Ethereum will aim to integrate scalability solutions such as the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and sharding. However, other platforms like EoS and Tezos that have already implemented Delegated Proof of Stake and are therefore already scalable will become smart-contract market leaders beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency and Immutability of blockchain will be threatened&lt;/strong&gt;. Our Western democratic political systems are mostly transparent, the outcomes of elections immutable. Moreover, similar to public blockchains, democratic political systems benefit from oppositional forces at play in a public sphere. Some protocols like EoS have established mechanisms that serve to mimic the division of powers found in democratic institutions. Those parties operating nodes containing vital economic information will need to operate transparently. It will therefore depend on public internet forums to hold the guardians of such smart-contract platforms accountable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion: the ability of public blockchains to allow us to collectively and transparently track economic inefficiencies in real-time rather than ‘ex post fact’ renders this technology worth being patient with. A system that incentives participation and invites criticism is why even as speculators flee the market, developers continue to build applications on top of Ethereum, and a generation brushes up on some of the more mundane topics of cryptography and computer science. A more transparent economic system for all to analyze, for all to critique, will be the prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8410cf96b1de" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/ethereum-falls-back-to-earth-can-it-re-ascend-8410cf96b1de"&gt;Ethereum Falls Back to Earth.

Blockchain can be programmed to record, not just financial transactions, but practically everything of value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantly growing as completed blocks in chronological order, blockchain allows market participants to keep track of digital currency transactions without central recordkeeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you follow the market updates too closely, it’s difficult to not be blinded by the obvious. Tonnes of transactions are carried out every minute, and trillions of dollars are moved around the outdated global financial system daily — and this process is still banked on paper works. This has increased the risk of economic and financial crime to a whopping&lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/publications/assets/pwc-gecs-2014-threats-to-the-financial-services-sector.pdf"&gt; 45 percent in the financial service sector&lt;/a&gt; of all industries, every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with blockchain, transactions are being protected automatically from several security hurdles. This provides maximum reliability, traceability, transparency, faster transactions, and improved data quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts, however, predicts that&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/2019-and-the-blockchain-affair-what-will-the-future-look-like-eec8227159d4"&gt; 2019 will be a massive year for blockchain&lt;/a&gt;. With promises of smart contracts, global and secure payments, token-based communities and transparent record keeping, no doubt blockchain is a hit this year!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several business sectors, companies in healthcare, financial services, even agriculture, are rushing to adopt the blockchain technology. Meanwhile, many of these businesses are doing so basically because of the fear of been left behind, without having crystal understanding of how it can be useful and when it should be applied to optimize their brand experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, therefore are four (4) tips on how to use blockchain to double business productivity this year:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Effectively manage your supply chain:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supply chains are a fundamental series of transactions that ensures the mobility of brands from production point to the final deployment. Due to the transparency of blockchain, your supply chain processes can be made much more visible and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howbeit that supply chains are evolving to become interconnected networks of partners. The propensity to instantly see all operational asset movements, as well as products, within your network is a huge benefit to logistics providers and those using their services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With blockchain, you can record brand rate, location, barcodes, quality, certification and other relevant information to explicitly manage your supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Boost direct customers’ target:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, an advertisement was built on the function of the middleman — whereby brands depends on third-party personnel, agencies, websites, and platforms from disparate sources to distribute targeted messages to all customers, irrespective of their objectives and interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howbeit that the blockchain technology serves greater ability to get across to customers — with a solid message and an intended branding. This allows the customer to set up a user profile directly with your brand, so, he gets ads that is only relevant to his needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, with blockchain, businesses can mitigate the risk of wasting marketing resources on customers with entirely different interest and objectives. You thereby tend to focus on marketing to the customer’s needs — since you have the customer’s profile already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Enhance transparency and traceability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchain works as an incorruptible digital ledger, that is recognized and validated in real time with each network participant. It authorizes equivalent visibility of activities and exposes where your business asset is, at any given point in time, in whose possession it is and in what condition it lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides, one of the biggest challenges in the logistics and transportation industry is the protection of its assets and cargoes. Moving freight with a lot of &lt;a href="https://autotransportquoteservices.com/auto-transport-companies/"&gt;auto transport companies&lt;/a&gt;, led to collaboration between AOS and IBM, to upgrade the efficiency of the transportation industry, providing a new truck tracking solution that uses IoT and blockchain to manage effective transactions between transport agents and clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With blockchain, businesses can &lt;a href="http://www.perfectmotivations.com/6-basic-misconceptions-all-business-owners-must-know-about-iot-in-2018/"&gt;enhance transparency and traceability&lt;/a&gt;, thereby creating room for a more friendly business relationship with customers. Also, you can account for a secure and unchangeable log of your customers’ delivery — thereby boosting customers confidence in your brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Improve data quality:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this era of privacy issues, you can use blockchain to maintain transaction data in a highly decentralized way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With blockchain, both small and large scale businesses can develop a more effective brand that communicates directly with customers while improving data quality and protecting user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, you can entrust an effective way of recording and sharing information between multiple partners in an encrypted form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expert predicts that in 2018, business will experience more smart contract deployment and decentralized exchanges. However, with blockchain, you can ensure that none of your organizational data can be rewritten or erased by anybody who has access to it. So you can be sure of communicating your true brand value to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Line:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchain experts predict that 2019 will be a milestone year that we will see the adoption of the first set of blockchain solutions in enterprise applications — from securing the pharmaceutical supply chain to eliminating inefficiency in international logistics. Regardless of your business sector, blockchain can help optimize your brand experience in all areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is therefore recommended that you begin to develop a blockchain prototype for your brand, to be at the competitive edge in your industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading…………&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a84aaf26a26" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/4-strategic-ways-to-use-blockchain-to-promote-business-productivity-in-2019-a84aaf26a26"&gt;4 Strategic Ways To Use Blockchain To Promote Business Productivity In 2019&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 17:46:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cointelegraph: YouTube Reportedly Runs Malicious Ad for Bitcoin Wallet Electrum by Accident -

To further cut costs and streamline processes, exchanges have been letting people go and closing offices all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, such measures could still not bring back exchanges back to their heyday of earning millions per day through wash trading and faking volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat this, many exchanges have chosen to lay low this crypto winter, ramping up on educational offerings to educate the communities on the benefits and potentials of blockchain technology and hopefully gain their business in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More ambitious exchanges have also taken the chance to explore other opportunities by exploring sophisticated offerings such as futures and options trading after witnessing Bitmex’s success in liquidating users’ fund and wanting a slice of it as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A current trending phenomenon in the crypto exchange-verse is bringing a glimmer of hope for exchanges in this crypto winter in the form of initial exchange offering (IEO), a new form of ICO which are simply ICOs held on exchanges. Proponents have seen this as an effective way of ensuring the quality of projects while opponents have seen this as yet another money grabbing opportunity for exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how can exchanges fully maximise this opportunity? We offer 4 tips for exchanges in this exclusive article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 1: Do not call it an IEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling an IEO an IEO is just so passe. It is best for you to blatantly deny that you have heard of an IEO before to differentiate your exchange and make your IEO offering stand out among the 100000 exchanges offering IEOs &lt;em&gt;— what does the “E” stands for anyway?&lt;/em&gt; We recommend to at least include a verb in the name to make your IEO brand sound more lively — E.g. words like run, launch, fly, rocket, next, sprint can be good starters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 2: Offer tiered packages to maximise the value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YOIO — You only IEO once. So why stop at a fixed price? Get your BD pals to come up with convoluted packages to leech projects dry as much as possible. &lt;em&gt;If you can’t convince, then confuse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend a progressive tiered format (&lt;em&gt;Of course, always aim for the highest tier &lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic tier: 50K for IEO&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VIP tier: 70K IEO + listing package&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Partner tier: 80K IEO + listing + PR package&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elite VIP tier: 100K IEO + listing + PR + marketing package&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super Elite VIP tier: 120K IEO + listing + PR + marketing + trading competition package&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIp 3: Always close the IEO within 30 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scarcity breeds demand. So always make an IEO sell out within 30 seconds — get the project or market maker to buy back tokens if necessary (at least for the first round) and shill the hell out of it — “ABC exchange sells out EFG token like hotcakes in 2.22 seconds”. After all, perception and branding are key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 4: Bring in your exchange token to the party&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, do not forget to weave in your exchange token wherever possible. In IEO sales as the preferred funding means, offering 30% bonus tokens or as lottery stakes for IEO… Then sit back and watch it moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this saturated market, it is indeed fight or flight for most exchanges. Other than existing tactics such as copy and pasting whatever big exchanges are doing, what do you think are some future innovation exchanges will come up with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=16c6036d2e86" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-can-crypto-exchanges-profit-in-this-bear-market-hint-ieo-16c6036d2e86"&gt;How can Crypto-Exchanges Profit in this Bear Market?

&lt;h2&gt;Remarks delivered at Funds Europe, European FundTech Lab event&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank Funds Europe for inviting me to speak at today&amp;rsquo;s event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Central Bank is to serve the public interest including by working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy. We recently published our Strategic Plan for 2019-2011. In that we identify five strategic objectives for the Central Bank: strengthening resilience, strengthening consumer protection, Brexit, engaging and influencing, including of course in Europe, and enhancing our organisational capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running through these strategic objectives is the issue of technological innovation and its implications for financial regulation. Specifically we say that we will identify and act upon the emerging risks, opportunities and challenges presented by financial innovation (Fintech) and the rapidly evolving technological landscape within which we, and the regulated firms and individuals that we supervise, operate. And that is what I would like to say a little about this afternoon: technological innovation, its risks, opportunities and challenges, seen from a financial regulatory perspective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before turning to that question, I mentioned that one of our Strategic Objectives for the next period is preparing for and responding to the challenges of Brexit. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say much about this topic today as I could not do it justice in a few short lines. I would refer you however, if you wish to know more about the Central Bank&amp;rsquo;s views on this, to the Opening Statement of Governor Lane to today&amp;rsquo;s hearing of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach; to the transcript of a recent interview by Deputy Governor Ed Sibley with the Irish Independent and available on our website&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;;  and to the recent speech by Deputy Governor Sharon Donnery at the Institute of International and European Affairs&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  These discuss the challenges of Brexit, including it&amp;rsquo;s potential impact on the economy, the long-running preparations and planning by the Central Bank to be ready for it, including for the risk of a no-deal Brexit, and the significantly increased resilience of the financial system as a result of the changes and improvements of the past ten years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Risks, Opportunities and Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now I would like to speak a bit more about why we have elevated our focus on innovation and technology.  Simply put, new technologies mean new risks, that we, as a regulator, need to understand, be prepared for, and respond to.  At the same time, new technology also means new opportunities, for customers, for firms, and for the Central Bank as a regulator.  We inform our focus on the risks with considerations of these opportunities.  And to do all this, we must be cognisant of the challenges involved for all participants in the financial services ecosystem.  So, risks, opportunities, challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As financial firms, and the financial system, become ever more data-driven and its customer interface ever more technological, new risks arise and old risks manifest in new ways. If one thinks of some of the key components of a well functioning financial system &amp;ndash; soundness, the prioritisation of consumer interests, trustworthiness, orderly functioning &amp;ndash; it is immediately clear the extent to which technological innovation, not strongly and effectively managed, can give rise to risks. To take some examples:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the risk, which I and my colleagues have spoken about often, that regulated firms&amp;rsquo; IT strategy, governance and risk management fail to keep pace with or remain aligned with their business strategy. IT weaknesses and failures are amongst those risks that we are most concerned about precisely because they go to the heart of regulated firms&amp;rsquo; activities while in many cases not having been given the level and quality of governance, risk management, or resilience testing that such functionality requires.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the risk that unsuitable products will be sold to consumers.  The risk of misselling has long been a concern of financial regulation.  But new technologies are changing the method of delivery with new types of sales platforms and new modalities of distribution. It is important we ensure these new platforms are not delivering poor outcomes for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the risk that the integrity of data systems becomes compromised with the result that customers personal data comes into unauthorised hands. Or that systems that customers rely on to carry on their day-to-day personal or business activities break down causing disruption and loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on . This is just a short list of examples of how technological innovation in financial services is giving rise to an evolution in the risks we think about - both the types of risk and how they manifest.  In order to be effective in our mission, we have to understand how risks are evolving with technology.  And that is one reason why innovation is an important aspect of our strategic planning for the coming period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just the risk, however, that we look at. There are of course significant opportunities represented by financial technological innovation. Opportunities for consumers, for the economy, for financial firms themselves. One of our jobs as a financial regulator is provide the framework whereby such opportunities can be realised in the context of a well-regulated financial sector.  New services, products and platforms for delivery can reduce costs, improve the user experience and promote financial inclusion and long-term savings.  Improvements in data analytics can also increase access to credit and insurance and allow for more tailored products and services.  Competition and new entrants can result in new and more efficient methods of payment and lower costs for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So too for firms. They have the opportunity to benefit from reduced costs, increased efficiencies, and new ways of engaging with the customer.  Firms will be in a good position to succeed if they can harness these opportunities while delivering real benefits for consumers and addressing the risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings us to the question of challenges related to innovation in financial services.  For regulators like the Central Bank, we need to ensure that our approaches to authorisation, supervision and policy-making continue to be high quality and effective as the sector evolves.  We need to ensure that our authorisation and supervision teams have the right skills to robustly challenge the firms that we regulate.  And we need to ensure that we are harnessing new technologies to most effectively deliver on our mandate. All the while ensuring that we do not unduly inhibit the development of innovation in the sector for the benefit of consumers. Let me say a few words then on some of the work that we have been doing at the Central Bank to ensure that we are well-equipped to address these challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Open and Active Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One important initiative that we have taken has been the launch one year ago of our Innovation Hub. This initiative is designed to do two things: to provide an informal and straightforward mechanism for innovators to engage with the Central Bank on the one hand; and to provide us with a good window onto the innovation that is taking place relevant to the financial sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Innovation Hub is a direct and dedicated point-of-contact at the Central Bank for firms&amp;mdash;both start-ups and incumbents&amp;mdash;developing or implementing innovations in financial services based on new technologies.  It provides an open platform for us to listen to innovators and enhance our sight of ongoing and upcoming developments in FinTech. We use that information to build on our existing intelligence on changes in the financial services landscape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks ago we published our Innovation Hub 2018 Update, which you can find on our website.&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt; This details the number (78) and types of engagement that we have seen come through the hub in its first eight months of operation. For example, 86% of enquiries came from unauthorised entities. Payments and RegTech firms were the type of entity that most contacted the hub, but enquiries came from across the spectrum of different sectors. All in all the hub is already showing that it is fulfilling the role we hoped it would including giving us better insight into the activities and perspectives of such innovators.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel with our domestic work in relation to Fin Tech, a lot has been going on over the past year in Europe as well. In particular, together with fellow financial regulators we have been engaged in work in all three of the European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, ESMA, and EIOPA).  In January, the ESAs published a comparative assessment of &amp;ldquo;innovation facilitators&amp;rdquo; in place at a national level, along with best practices in their design and operation.  The report is intended to promote convergence in the design and operation of innovation facilitators and thereby protect the level playing field across Europe.  In addition to best practices&amp;mdash;with which, the Central Bank of Ireland&amp;rsquo;s Innovation Hub is very much in step&amp;mdash;the report recommended the creation of a European network to bridge innovation facilitators established at the member state level.  The Central Bank is supportive of this effort and we look forward to participating in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cryptoassets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One issue related to Financial Technological Innovation that has been the subject of quite a bit of work in both EBA and ESMA over the past year has been that of cryptoassets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges with cryptoassets is to be clear as to exactly what we are talking about. ESMA, in its recent report to the European Commission on the subject&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;  notes that the term can refer to both virtual currencies and to digital tokens which are associated with initial coin offerings (ICOs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of years the Central Bank has issued warnings or alerts to consumers about the risks associated with virtual currencies and with ICOs. These have reflected similar warnings or alerts issued by the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). The risks that gave rise to these warnings include high levels of volatility and risk of loss, the absence of protections associated with unregulated activities, inadequate and/or misleading information, the risk of technological flaws, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since those warnings were issued work has continued amongst the regulatory community in Europe to consider what more, if anything, might be needed in relation to this area of activity. This work resulted in the publication earlier this year of reports by both ESMA and EBA on the question of cryptoassets.&lt;sup&gt;5 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both reports agree that anti-money laundering rules (AML) should apply to all activities involving crypto assets. They recommend that the European framework incorporate the October 2018 Financial Action Task Force FATF recommendations on the topic.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;   This would bring &amp;ldquo;virtual assets&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;virtual asset service providers&amp;rdquo; into the Anti-money laundering / Counter terrorism financing (AML/CTF) framework. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESMA was asked by the European Commission to consider the legal nature of crypto assets. In particular whether, and the extent to which, individual cryptoassets fall within the meaning of financial instruments and/or transferable securities, and therefore within the scope of existing financial regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a complicated question. Firstly, cryptoassets can take a wide variety of forms. And depending upon this they may or may not fall within the scope of existing legislation and regulation. To the extent that a cryptoasset does fall within existing regulation, then those responsible for its issuance, distribution, or trading are required to comply with the requirements of the relevant regulation. Secondly, there are also differences of approach across the different jurisdictions, both in relation to the interpretation of particular terms and concepts and also in how the issue of cryptoassets is approached.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives rise to an important and differentiated set of recommendations. To the extent that cryptoassets do fall within the meaning of transferable securities or other type of MiFID financial instrument then there are a number of potential gaps in the framework and potential for inconsistent approaches given that the frameworks were not designed with these types of assets or technology in mind. ESMA recommends that the European Commission gives consideration as to these aspects and to addressing the gaps identified.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerning cryptoassets which do not fall within the meaning of transferable securities or within the scope of existing regulation, ESMA considers that a priority issue to be addressed in addition to the AML aspect is the need to have appropriate risk disclosure aspects in place. These should include disclosure in relation to the issuer, the project, the rights attached to the cryptoasset, the underlying technology, and potential conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As concerns a wider regime of regulation ESMA considers that there are trade-offs in this regard, in particular as that risks legitimising cryptoassets and encouraging wider adoption. Therefore at this stage ESMA&amp;rsquo;s advises to focus on disclosure and warning rather than a wider regime. EBA in its report recommends that the Commission should carry out a cost-benefit analysis to consider the trade-offs of a regulatory framework. It also advises that work be done, alongside the work of the Basel Committee to develop an agreed prudential treatment for cryptoassets,  to promote consistency in approach in accountancy treatment of such assets. In the meantime a conservative prudential approach should be adopted by supervisors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally under this heading, let me mention that in light of what is discussed above &amp;ndash; our warnings to consumers, the high levels of uncertainty, the liquidity and valuation challenges   - at the Central Bank of Ireland we do not consider that funds authorised for retail investors, in particular UCITS, should at this time, provide exposure to cryptoassets notwithstanding that the fund is managed by a professional investment manager.  We are not convinced that it is possible to cover the risks in the manner necessary for a retail fund.  We also note the difficulties for depositaries associated with providing safekeeping where direct investments in virtual currencies are foreseen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A final thought on this topic. Given the importance of the sustainable finance agenda in achieving European and Global climate change prevention objectives, there is surely a question around the compatibility with that agenda of cryptoassets which make disproportionate draws on non-renewable energy resources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Outsourcing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would like to turn now to a topic which has, because of it&amp;rsquo;s importance in the area of information technology, a direct link to the question of financial technological innovation. But it is also a topic which is enormously important more generally and has a particular importance in the fund space. It is the topic of outsourcing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognise the significant benefits that outsourcing can bring to firms and, thereby, to their customers.  Outsourcing can help firms to avail of economies of scale, provide services to global customers on a 24/7 basis and access skills and expertise that may not be available in-house, all the while helping to manage costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, significant risks may accompany these benefits. It is essential, if the benefits are to be realised, that these risks are governed and managed effectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the different sectors, outsourcing has been an important area of focus for the Central Bank over the recent period. And it continues to be. We have assessed regulated firms&amp;rsquo; management of outsourcing-related risks through targeted onsite inspections and through wider thematic reviews. In many cases, significant remediation work has been required of firms in order to provide assurance that risks are effectively managed. As we continue to engage with firms on this subject it has become clear that more work is required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this work and in recognition of the growth and evolution of the outsourcing landscape, the Central Bank has more recently embarked on a cross-sectoral review of outsourcing. This has included the completion of a survey of regulated firms&amp;rsquo; outsourcing activity and analysis of the findings from our direct supervisory work on outsourcing. The findings from this exercise led to the publication of our discussion paper entitled &amp;lsquo;Outsourcing &amp;ndash; Findings and Issues for Discussion&amp;rsquo; in November of last year.&lt;sup&gt;7 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the paper is twofold.  First, it brings together the Central Bank&amp;rsquo;s findings and observations from our work across different sectors over the recent period and sets out our minimum supervisory expectations around the management of outsourcing risk. Our work in this regard is taking place in parallel with and is fully informed by similar work underway in Europe. We have been closely involved for example in the work culminating in the recent publication of EBA&amp;rsquo;s revised guidelines on outsourcing.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings set out in our document are concerning; they point to weaknesses involving poor governance and controls around risk assessment and management of outsourcing, inadequate monitoring and reporting, failure to consider outsourced service providers in business continuity planning and testing, and a lack of exit strategies, amongst other weaknesses. This is of concern to the Central Bank, particularly as many of the findings relate to outsourcing arrangements that were deemed critical or important by the firms surveyed. The Central Bank expects that actions required to address such weaknesses are identified and implemented by the boards and management of regulated firms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the paper highlights some of the key risks and evolving trends associated with outsourcing. It seeks to initiate discussion with industry around the challenges presented by these evolving risks and challenges and how they should be effectively managed. The risks considered include; sensitive data risk, concentration risk, offshoring, chain-outsourcing and substitutability. Feedback has been sought from industry on the paper and we are considering the submissions that we have received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A significant evolving feature of outsourcing is the continuing increased use of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). The use of CSPs brings benefits to regulated firms, such as access to specialist skills and technology, scalability and cost management.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a concern that many firms lack the knowledge and skills to truly understand the service they are receiving and how to effectively oversee it. Such arrangements require careful consideration and planning on the part of regulated firms. Appropriate governance and risk management measures must be in place to ensure that the Board and senior management of regulated firms can demonstrate that risks are appropriately identified, measured, monitored and managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing to the cloud also raises concerns surrounding location and security of customer and business sensitive data. The nature of many cloud solutions means that data can be segmented and disseminated to different servers in different locations. At any point in time, firms need to have clear visibility as to where their data is and in the event of any disruption, how they would get it back. Firms should also employ strategies to ensure that they are not essentially &amp;lsquo;locked-in&amp;rsquo; to a provider and hence unable to switch to an alternative should the need arise. Ensuring appropriate security, resilience, business continuity and exit strategy planning is key when considering outsourcing to the cloud. Regulated firms must always be cognisant that even though they outsource the activity, they always retain the responsibility for it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Outsourcing and Funds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition to the extensive work that has been undertaken in relation to outsourcing on a cross-sectoral basis, I wanted to take this opportunity to say a few words about the Central Bank&amp;rsquo;s work on this issue for the funds sector specifically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset, it is important to clarify that under the UCITS and AIFMD frameworks, no distinction is drawn between the terms &amp;lsquo;outsourcing&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;delegation&amp;rsquo;.  Indeed, as set out in the recent discussion paper, the Central Bank is clear that no difference may be inferred where these terms are used.  In all cases, whether it is called delegation or outsourcing, it must be subject effective due diligence, appropriate oversight arrangements and good governance to ensure that any tasks not performed by the regulated entity are carried out to a high standard with ultimate responsibility for the function being retained by the regulated entity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard, the Central Bank has conducted extensive work in relation to Fund Management Company effectiveness &amp;ndash; often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;CP86&amp;rdquo; body of work. This work involved three separate Central Bank consultations and ultimately culminated in the introduction of some new requirements and extensive guidance for fund management companies.  These have been in full effect for all management companies since July 2018.  In the coming period, we will be carrying out an important exercise to review how management companies have implemented these requirements, and to consider whether the outcomes sought are being achieved and whether further guidance may be needed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, in 2016, Central Bank supervisors carried out a review of fund administration outsourcing arrangements.  This work was undertaken as outsourcing is a key area of operational risk of almost all large Fund Administrators.  At that time, the Central Bank issued observations and recommendations which are to be taken into account by fund administrators when considering outsourcing arrangements.  These are now part of our formal guidance for fund administrators on outsourcing and we continue to review the way in which they are applied.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, consideration of issues in relation to depositary delegation has been underway at the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) for some time.  The Central Bank is very supportive of this work as consistent application of the requirements under UCITS and AIFMD for depositaries is critical.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will conclude here.  As a final word, let me reiterate that the Central Bank is openly and actively engaged with innovation.  That we are focused on understanding and responding to the risks presented by new technologies, so that the opportunities presented can be realised and the challenges overcome.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

My name is Anton, and I’m the CTO at &lt;a href="https://crypto.tickets"&gt;crypto.tickets.&lt;/a&gt; Crypto Tickets has developed the new decentralized ticketing protocol that protects tickets from being counterfeited or double sold. The appeals of Crypto Tickets for event organizers are the abilities to control the secondary market, retain extra commissions on every ticket resale, prohibit resales entirely, or allow resales only for authorized fans. This technology is designed to be an add-on for any ticket selling technology on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Integers?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you know, Ethereum smart contracts can’t handle real (floating point) numbers easily. So, we all work with integers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, if you work with percentages, you will have to divide one number by another. That’s where rounding comes in. For example, imagine you need to send “13% as dividends” to the account A. What if you have 10 tokens to split? Should you round 1.3 tokens to 1 or 2? It’s obvious that 1.3 should be rounded to 1. It’s high school math, nothing interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are common approaches to dealing with real numbers in smart contracts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/blob/master/docs/recommendations.md#beware-rounding-with-integer-division"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some store the numerator and denominator as separate variables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; so you can describe 1/3 by storing 1 in the numerator and 3 in the denominator, but that’s a different story for another time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story begins when you have to round 1.5. What if we always round it to 1? Your system will accumulate the error and your investor will ALWAYS loose dividends. If you round it to 2, you will ALWAYS lose money. Imagine you send dividends millions of times. Is there any way we can reduce the accumulated error?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers are not necessarily always against the whole society. They have something that we can use called “bankers rounding,” aka “round-half-to-even”. The idea is that when a number is halfway between two others, it is rounded toward the nearest &lt;strong&gt;even&lt;/strong&gt; number. For instance, 2.125 rounds down to 2.12. Meanwhile, 2.135 rounds up to 2.14. Other decimal fractions are rounded according to the same method: 2.122 to 2.12, 2.127 to 2.13, -2.122 to -2.12, etc. So, you won’t ALWAYS lose money, just like your client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8WA1LlwZZoZU10aw" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, let’s introduce that function to the cryptocurrency world!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In crypto.tickets we use smart contracts for accounting (We call it “billing”), so when the ticket is resold on the secondary market, the event organizer receives 50% of the markup as a fee. Let’s describe how and where we use bankers rounding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;feeOrg_ppm&lt;/em&gt; store the number of dividend ppms the event organizer should receive. Ppm stands for parts-per-million, so 1% is 10000 ppm. Eventually, &lt;em&gt;feeOrg_ppm&lt;/em&gt; will be equal to 50000.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;markup_cents&lt;/em&gt; store the current markup, for example, 14 cents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate how much the organizer should receive, we use this simple formula:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/4218c5c603531086bf1fd4200ee4e819/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/4218c5c603531086bf1fd4200ee4e819/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where the &lt;em&gt;bankersRoundedDiv()&lt;/em&gt; method comes in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/59732523c448fa38eec502aeffa2d4f6/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/59732523c448fa38eec502aeffa2d4f6/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;If markup_cents is 14, then the event organizer will receive &lt;strong&gt;7 cents&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If markup_cents is 15, then the event organizer will receive &lt;strong&gt;8 cents&lt;/strong&gt; (7.5 is rounded to the nearest even number).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If markup_cents is 17, then the event organizer will receive &lt;strong&gt;8 cents&lt;/strong&gt; (8.5 is rounded to the nearest even number which is still 8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;“Bankers Rounding” Code&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code is available here &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptoticket/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/RoundedDivMath.sol#L53"&gt;— https://github.com/cryptoticket/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/RoundedDivMath.sol#L53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/4e254fc4977c149d77e79879ee73f173/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/4e254fc4977c149d77e79879ee73f173/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests are available here &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptoticket/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/test/math/RoundedDivMath.test.js"&gt;— https://github.com/cryptoticket/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/test/math/RoundedDivMath.test.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Round-half-to-even helps you minimize the accumulated error, so your client will be happy when receiving fees or dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to contact me: &lt;a href="mailto: tony@crypto.tickets"&gt;tony@crypto.tickets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2bccd0b664" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/bankers-rounding-for-smart-contracts-2bccd0b664"&gt;“Bankers Rounding” for Smart Contracts&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 16:56:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Finovate: Tandem Chooses Token as Open Banking, PSD2 Partner -  Puntaje: 3000</title><link>https://finovate.com/tandem-chooses-token-as-open-banking-psd2-partner/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Digital U.K. challenger bank Tandem is working with open banking platform provider Token.io to ensure PSD2 compliance and take advantage of the opportunities of open banking.
