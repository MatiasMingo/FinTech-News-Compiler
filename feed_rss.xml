Today we launched &lt;a href="https://party.lol/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Party Club&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! It encrypts any site, so that Tech Giants don’t know if you are talking about cat videos, the Christchurch attack, or Apple’s new streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it be 1984, Hunger Games, The Matrix, Equilibrium, Animal Farm, or Fight Club… there is one common theme. The underdog revolution against brain-sucking corporate Big Brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*EoKoD4Y_aHG5NZ1yx2bmqw.gif" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, we’ve had enough. Today. &lt;strong&gt;Today is the day&lt;/strong&gt;, that the internet rises up! Today we fight back, except its cooler than the movies — its real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Party Mode&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Party Mode should be used on public or quasi-public sites — Reddit, Slack, Facebook groups, etc. gosh, it is &lt;strong&gt;especially fun&lt;/strong&gt; on sites like these, such as our &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/amark/gun"&gt;chatroom&lt;/a&gt; where people are going nuts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s right, your inside jokes can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;stay inside!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; That’s right, on any site. Here it is working on YouTube — when you click on any text/comment area, this little encryptor popup snaps into view:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gcxfocj-i0gECMpLdd2evw.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then you can write your message, and it’ll encrypt &amp;amp; paste it back into the input. Here is an example of it working on Twitter direct messages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*lR7hacWshMrIHtdMizXCGQ.gif" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHeee&lt;em&gt;eeeeee!!&lt;/em&gt; It is a lot of fun. You should &lt;a href="https://party.lol"&gt;install it now&lt;/a&gt;! But, you might ask:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Party Mode uses Bitcoin-like Proof-of-Work to derive keys. No, this is not a blockchain, there is no pay-to-play scam. The idea is to use PoW (PBKDF2) to melt the NSA’s servers if they were try to do mass surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a concrete example. Facebook gets 10K+ posts/second; it would take them about ~1hour to decrypt 1 second worth of Party Mode data. They are better off mining Bitcoin to pollute their eco-reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/privacy-what-you-need-to-know-e183ef3563c1"&gt;Privacy = Going Green&lt;/a&gt;. Spying = Environmentally Impure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*i5B515Ui3h0eyEcZUYAgVQ.gif" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you probably only get less than ~10 posts/second (sorry, I’m not that popular either! :/ But I bet &lt;a href="https://era.eco/party/logo.gif"&gt;PARTY PARROT&lt;/a&gt; is!). This means you are totally eco-friendly, nothing to worry about!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although note, disclaimer, since anyone else at the party can decrypt posts, nothing stops somebody from reporting something you said to moderators. If Google does a &lt;em&gt;targeted&lt;/em&gt; attack on &lt;em&gt;a specific post&lt;/em&gt;, they (and/or others) will be able to decrypt it just as fast as you and your friends can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what can we do to stop targeted attacks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Secret Agent Mode&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secret Agent Mode is intended to be used on private channels like, &lt;strong&gt;email&lt;/strong&gt;, Twitter DMs, Facebook private messages, etc., and is perfect for confidential exchanges with clients or colleagues, or chatting with your gf/bf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vm4-oQ4nZ-6EXbUIxym9yg.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works by using peer-to-peer Diffie-Hellman key exchange, see the GitHub for &lt;a href="https://github.com/eraeco/party.lol#can-websites-scrape-data-after-it-is-decrypted-no"&gt;more details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But come on! Let’s get the party started. If you have installed it already, your browser should have automatically decrypted the next paragraph. If you just see a bunch of gibberish, well, we know who is waiting outside all alone. ;) &lt;a href="https://party.lol"&gt;Get it now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whole new internet. Secure, decentralized, private, and owned by you! &lt;strong&gt;Today!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Matrix sentinels, no 1984, no pigs. Just Party Parrot! Fight censorship, prevent spying, change the internet today. Upvote on &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/private-party"&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; and HackerNews and Reddit, retweet on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marknadal"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (I’ll be revealing several easter eggs today, so maker sure to follow), &lt;a href="https://party.lol"&gt;install&lt;/a&gt;, make secret jokes on Facebook, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PARTY ON&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

At that time, few cryptos like Ethereum and Bitcoin were all over the news making popular headlines as prices kept soaring high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that many enterprising individuals and business organizations saw the need to adopt relevant blockchain solutions by investing in the technology. Most folks who were already tired of the old, dysfunctional monetary system didn’t hesitate to join in the bandwagon too. Within two months, the crypto market seemed to have gone out of control, blowing everyone’s imagination with a 400 percent increase in value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Bitcoin was (and still) leading at the top of the table with the greatest market share, Ethereum was making remarkable waves in its own way second to it. At this point, it seemed as if the sky was going to be the limit for this new blockchain technology until something happened. It was at this time, that things began to slow down dramatically simply because Ethereum and other crypto networks were inundated with transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With other many factors, it was evident that blockchain technology was not fully ready to meet up with users expectations based on the huge promises made about it. It was upon this realization that the entire market went into a huge decline and it’s still yet to recover. However, it is interesting to know that Ethereum and its proponents have all been making giant strides to not only make a big come back but likely take over the blockchain platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need to know about Ethereum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other blockchain solutions available today, Ethereum is an operating system designed for feature smart contract functionality. Basically, it operates as a blockchain-based distributed computing platform with open-source ability. The blockchain platform is established to provide users with a secure means of storing information and making quick and convenient transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2015, the Ethereum platform went live. It was at this time that Ether was launched by the open source blockchain network as its own cryptocurrency. Despite shedding a significant amount of its value in the last couple of years, Ethereum has still managed to hold its position among the top three cryptos in the market. Currently, it is now valued above $100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, several industries and reputable IT professionals like Steve Wozniak have touted this amazing blockchain platform to be the next big thing in the IT world and the entire industry. Due to the fact that the blockchain solutions offered by Ethereum can change lots of different processes and transform industries, many entrepreneurs and business owners are already beginning to have a very positive outlook on Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a good number of tech analysts believe and are also very positive that Ethereum will do to the blockchain industry what Apple did to the mobile industry. To people like Steve Wozniak, Ethereum is capable of sparking the next big IT revolutions that is imminent to the extent of controlling the entire industry. No doubt, it won’t take up to a decade for this dynamic blockchain technology to achieve its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Ethereum have in store?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like several other cryptos, Ethereum is unrelated to a central authority such as governments simply because its operations are based on mathematical settings that can rarely be altered. It is pure science. Interestingly, many blockchain companies established today are adopting this technology to help enable business growth and development in several industries. By implication, there is no limit to what can be achieved with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just so you know, Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency, it is in itself a platform. Today, there are quite a good number of blockchain companies that are adopting this open-source platform to carry out some crypto-related projects. When it comes to using cryptocurrencies, Ethereum provides one of the most secure and reliable platforms for such development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform offers several blockchain solutions that are widely used by many modern enterprises. It is rarely difficult to experience third-party interference, censorship or even fraud with Ethereum it runs exactly as programmed. Basically, the platform is designed to feature smart contract functionality as an efficient operating system and distributed computing platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How companies can benefit using Ethereum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a viable blockchain technology, many experts and professionals in the industry strongly believed that Ethereum can be used to create other applications, as well as initiate major changes in a wide range of industries. Already some blockchain companies have begun adopting the technology to not only drive digital currency exchange but also improve security in many other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security of financial data and other important information has been a major global concern to big tech players and every other person involved in the industry. There has been wide adoption of this technology to improve security in recent pasts as part of efforts to strengthen existing security solutions. Today, there are many developers and blockchain companies that are looking to make use of the decentralized platform to build and design a range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to see how this technology is been efficiently used across a wide range of industries to address certain challenges associated with digital transactions including currency reproductions, frauds, chargebacks, cross border transactions, data security, and double spending across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Crooks is Content Writer who writes for Hyperlink InfoSystem, a mobile app development company in New York, USA and India that holds the best team of skilled and expert &lt;a href="https://www.hyperlinkinfosystem.com/android-app-development-india.htm"&gt;app developers&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s simple, you post an old photo from 2009 next to a recent photo taken in 2019 and give it a nice caption. Somewhat like this 👇&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*cDafl9XsUYmLB0Lb" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Same old Salesforce, just 10x bigger and better 😬&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While people are going nuts posting their 10-year challenges, data scientists are happy that they found a golden data set to train their facial recognition algorithms. Jokes apart, on a serious note I started wondering what if SaaS took the 10-Year-Challenge.. Presenting to you “The SaaS 10-Year Challenge”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TItUFBHaP1aNsbLOzOqwkA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some interesting trends and understand how far we came across as an industry!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From “selling software” to “serving customers”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back in the day if you were a SaaS company, you were selling software on cloud… no setup costs, no installations and no worries about downtime/maintenance in order to upgrade. In 2019, if you think you are selling software, you are mistaken. You are &lt;em&gt;actually offering your service as a software&lt;/em&gt;, companies who understood this shift are the ones leading the market. According to SaaS veteran &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/52d45a2865c1"&gt;David Cancel&lt;/a&gt; (CEO, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/e7a3db4bbcc3"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;customer experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; is the new marketing and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;helping&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; is the new sales&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2009, SaaS was a relatively new thing without budgets and line items for software spend in most P&amp;amp;L statements. This meant a new challenge for SaaS entrepreneurs, since it was a blue ocean, they had to educate the market before selling their products. When I asked &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/1f25b7d5396b"&gt;Pat Grady&lt;/a&gt; (Sequoia) about &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/8732e73183e5"&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;’s journey, he said during the first five years, almost every quarter was a slog. Fast forward to 2019, customers are already using some form of cloud software to run their operations. So buyers are asking a different question — “So, why should I switch?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Until 2009, Software was about streamlining business operations by saving costs, time and thus making the org more efficient. Developers didn’t really care about user experience and PMs didn’t measure customer engagement once the software was bought. Reporting was the sole feature that drew buyer’s attention and users had very little say in the purchase process. This started changing suddenly, thanks to Apple, Google and Facebook who created delightful experiences for consumers. Launch of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/f7b89f8b2e99"&gt;Zendesk&lt;/a&gt; (2009) brought in smiles to support agents faces, much like the “zen” in their name. Today, if you are a SaaS company nothing matters more than customer experience. With pay-as-you-go model becoming the norm &amp;amp; retention being the key driver for growth, 2019 has a new bar for building and selling SaaS products. Companies like Drift, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/bc415f9e3258"&gt;Superhuman&lt;/a&gt;, Notion etc. are setting an example for next-gen software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019 is the beginning of the Golden Era of SaaS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2009, SaaS was the new kid on the block… today it’s the golden era of SaaS. I almost see 2019 as the 1999 dot-com revolution but for B2B software with better economics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salesforce hits $1B ARR for the &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/25/salesforce-hits-1-billion-dollars-in-annual-revenues/"&gt;first time in 2009&lt;/a&gt; and today, it does $13.8 Billion in ARR. This means &lt;a href="https://tomtunguz.com/time-to-disrupt-incumbents/"&gt;1% of Salesforce revenue&lt;/a&gt; makes you a unicorn 🦄 (1%*$13.8B = $138M ARR ~ $1.38B valuation). I shared my thoughts on this topic recently on Twitter when people were wondering how Zoom built a $300M ARR business in a crowded Video Conferencing market&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*YSFu0DrYWCSPY1pE" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To which Rahul Vohra (Founder, Superhuman) replied nodding his head..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rPWbpryCVE-uf0nA" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commoditization of SaaS&lt;/strong&gt;: We started seeing category leaders emerge in 2009, companies like &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/7b847836aa03"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/2d2c8f4cb281"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, Gainsight were just getting started. Today we have at-least a dozen similar companies, with almost similar value prop (features) and very little differentiation. For example, take a look at the much crowded Help Desk Software category, G2Crowd says there are &lt;a href="https://www.g2crowd.com/categories/help-desk"&gt;at-least 40 SaaS companies&lt;/a&gt; let alone the ones who didn’t make it to their magic quadrant. Imagine how painful it is for a customer to decide on what tool to use?&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Almost all software ultimately becomes a commodity. Only differentiator left is Brand, don’t screw up that one :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The catalysts behind the exposition in SaaS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2009 was the beginning of API revolution — the hidden backbone which allowed software applications to communicate with each other. Today, APIs are eating the world and middleware companies are minting money. The leader in this space &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/1d08fbe24b8b"&gt;MuleSoft&lt;/a&gt; was acquired by &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/f4fb2a348280"&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt; for a whopping $6.5B post IPO!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Until 2009 it was just about SaaS, but we started seeing the IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) revolution. The AWS ec2 free tier got me to sign-up for hosting my website and that’s it.. I was hooked! Today, I’d be surprised if you are a Developer and not using IaaS platforms to build your software. AWS, GCP, Azure are leading the Cloud Infrastructure market followed by companies like Segment establishing themselves as leaders in a niche category like Customer Data Infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funding in SaaS markets is at all-time high right now. In 2009, $100M ARR meant a billion dollar valuation (~10x multiple) and you are ready to go IPO as a SaaS business. Today more and more SaaS companies are trying to remain private and file for an IPO when their revenues are in the range of $300M-$500M ARR or just get acquired by private equity shops (like Vista Equity Partners, Openview etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some other fun facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2009, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/e67120d2dec7"&gt;Jason M. Lemkin&lt;/a&gt; (Founder of SaaStr) was still at Adobe (post EchoSign acquisition) and well known SaaS blogger Tomasz Tunguz just left his PM gig at Google to join &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/e326ed3f18d"&gt;Redpoint Ventures&lt;/a&gt; 😇&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most celebrated SaaS unicorn &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/3ecae35d6d66"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t even exist in 2009! Today, Stripe has given birth to a whole bunch of subscription businesses and I bet they are the market leader when it comes to powering payments for SaaS companies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And finally, you’d have said bonkers if &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/a765f651bcda"&gt;McDonald&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; decides to buy a SaaS company for $300M. This week (2019) McD snapped &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/774fe5a6bbe3"&gt;Dynamic Yield&lt;/a&gt; (machine learning platform) to create an Amazon style personalized experiences for their customers. Welcome to the future! 😍&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being in SaaS today is like being a painter during the Renaissance. If you know how to build and sell software, you are unstoppable. It’s never too late, come join the SaaS movement..

                &lt;br&gt;Over the next few weeks, MEDICI brings you a series of articles exploring FinTech in the ASEAN region. The articles, each focused on a different ASEAN country, provide comprehensive insights into the FinTech investment landscape in the region. ASEAN in Figures ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is the third-largest Asian region. It is home to more than 630 million people and one-fourth of the population lives in urban areas. ASEAN has an annual growth rate of 4.7% and USD 119.97 billion in FDI; it is also one of the fastest-growing regions as well as the seventh-largest economy globally. Its population is young and educated with a literacy rate of over 80%, phone-savvy with more than 0.5 phones per person, and enjoys a low-to-mid unemployment rate of 0.5%–6.9%. ASEAN members also have an average to a high life expectancy of 69–82.7 years, and a gender parity of 49.9% males...&lt;br/&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2019 14:49:00 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>NBC technology: IBM artificial intelligence can predict with 95% accuracy if you plan to quit your job -  Puntaje: 1000.0</title><link>https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/03/ibm-ai-can-predict-with-95-percent-accuracy-which-employees-will-quit.html</link><description>IBM AI can predict with 95 percent accuracy when an employee is about to leave their job.

&lt;div&gt;Saxo Bank, the online trading and investment specialist, has published today its Q2 2019 Quarterly Outlook for global markets, including trading ideas covering equities, FX, currencies, commodities, and bonds, as well as a range of central macro themes impacting client portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The euro could struggle to rally until a path towards EMU deepening opens up”, says Steen Jakobsen, Chief Economist and CIO, Saxo Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The gulf between European valuations and their US counterparts remains high with Europe trading at a massive discount. Part of this lies with the composition of business – Europe has less technology firms and more privately-owned companies. In fact, the most truly successful companies in Europe remain in private hands, and for good reason as they refuse to cave to short-term, quarterly earnings report-centred strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The view from the outside is that Europe is a perennial basket case. This is an easy conclusion to reach if you don’t understand Europe’s history, its vested interests, the peace dividend and the need for government to sell the naive illusion of fiscal self-rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We firmly believe that any macro change has to come from a breakdown or a crisis, and as such we see 2019 and 2020 as key years for Europe’s evolution. We foresee populist parties getting 20% if not 25% of the popular vote in May’s European parliament elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most important, factor, though is the collapse of German growth. We see a risk of recession there by Q4 even without a trade spat with the US. Germany, with its very successful “industry 3.0” model, is being left behind. Underinvestment in the technology sector leaves it unprepared as “industry 4.0” rolls in, and its internet speed ranking is just one of many symptoms. Germany needs to catch up in terms of digitalisation, in terms of programmes for working women, with new airports and more overall infrastructure spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The lapse of Germany will reopen the Franco-German “hotline” as well as making the debt issue a pan-European issue, and not one of Germany versus the PIIGS, or austerity versus free spending. Investors long convinced by talk of basket cases would be unwise to count out Europe. It is, after all, perfectly positioned to benefit from automation, AI, digitalisation and a capital market that is cheap by any standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Q2 will see the noise increase; the “basket case” narrative will be spread far and wide and the EUR, led by the ECB, will probably test 1.05 if not 1.03 versus the dollar. The next 12 months, however, will be 2000 all over again.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this uncertain backdrop, Saxo’s main trading ideas and themes for Q2 include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities – the great divergence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depressing reality is that European companies have had negative real growth in operating earnings as the region lacks a strong technology sector that capitalises on the digital age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Garnry, Head of Equity Strategy, said: “We remain defensive on equities until there is evidence of a turning point as contracting economies with below-trend activity have historically delivered negative equity returns. Within Europe, this macro environment is typically bad for Europe’s cyclical equity markets such as Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and France. The equity markets that usually do relatively well in a poor economic environment are Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of Europe’s biggest problems remains the banking sector. The total return on Europe’s banking sector is zero since January 2003; in real terms, it’s -28.5% over a 15-year period. This is an ugly parallel to Japan’s zombie banks after its meltdown in the 1990s. Europe has also agreed to implement costly banking regulations, driving up costs on an already weak sector. It has been 10 years since Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy and Europe’s banking sector has still not healed; this will continue to be an anchor constraining growth and equity returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FX – Europe has most to lose and most to gain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe is in a potential lose-lose situation as we await the outcome of the US-China trade negotiations. The friendlier the deal, the more likely that China could shift some of its import demand away from Europe and towards the US. With or without a friendly deal, risks point to ongoing de-globalization and a growth slowdown that would be double trouble for the European Union, the world’s largest trade surplus economic bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Europe stumbles towards recession later this year or early next year, the old existential questions will inevitably rise once more to dog the EU political and financial landscape. In short, Saxo believes that Europe deserves a considerable portion of our attention as Q2 will inevitably prove an important pivot point for the EU. Either we see escalating signs of further dysfunction or a more determined shift by EU governments to get ahead of the risks of rising populism and the unworkable fiscal/European Central Bank foundation of the EMU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Hardy, Head of FX Strategy, said: “Our least favourite currencies in a weakening global growth environment are the commodity dollar currencies, where housing bubbles are in various stages of unwinding, inevitably impacting the credit and therefore growth outlooks. Our longer-term bullish call on commodities should eventually offset downside risks, but these risks will prevail until central bank policy in these countries looks like it does for the rest of the DM – i.e. more or less ZIRP and central bank balance sheet expansion to clean up the private credit mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Growth risks remain a concern for emerging markets, but we think China provides a backdrop of stability as it seeks to maintain a stable currency and attract capital inflows to deepen its capital markets and accommodate its transition to becoming a deficit country (a key step in shifting the CNY to an eventual reserve asset). The JPY could do well during bouts of risk deleveraging this year, but the Japanese government is perhaps the most ready to switch on the fiscal stimulus, with the Bank of Japan happy to cooperate as it seeks to avoid yen volatility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities power ahead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commodity sector delivered a surprisingly strong return during the first quarter of 2019 with the Bloomberg Commodity Index trading higher by 9%. This remarkable development relates to the fact that the rise was led by growth-dependent commodities such as energy (+17%) and industrial metals (+12.5%). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets, including commodities, began the year on the defensive with growth concerns and US Federal Reserve-led liquidity tightening raising concerns about the prospects for 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year, however, was only a few weeks old before global policy panic set in. In early January, the Fed hit the pause button before abandoning it at the end of the quarter while calling a halt to further quantitative tightening. The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank followed suit with their own measures, while in China the government stepped in with various initiatives to stabilise the economy as the chance of a trade deal between Washington and Beijing helped sentiment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy, “The dramatic recent turnaround at the Fed is seen as bullish for gold as the return to a dovish stance highlights the risk of a gold-supportive recession within the next 12 months. The second quarter, however, may not yet provide the spark gold needs to break strong resistance between $1,360/oz and $1,380/oz. Into the second half, however, a formidable challenge could be seen amid support from a weaker dollar, stable to lower bond yields and concerns about global stocks’ ability to forge higher amid raised growth concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macro – You can’t fight gravity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a huge shift in the global macro backdrop over the last six months and it has huge structural significance for both Asia and the world as a whole. The crux of the matter is that central bankers, led by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, have unequivocally failed to attain escape velocity from quantitative easing. The gravitational pull of addiction to lose money has led to pampered stock and bond markets, as well as some remarkable events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saxo believes that we shouldn’t be surprised about escaping this QE world, particularly given debt levels are now north of $250 trillion as compared to $175 trillion before the financial crisis. The bank does feel though that the speed with which we have been pulled back in, was surprising. The implication is now that, until a “great debt reset” (read: haircuts, restructuring and a debt jubilee) that could still be five to ten years away, it’s back to QE for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay Van-Petersen, Global Macro Strategist, “Taking the world back to looser monetary policy and lower yields will be bullish for bonds and equities. Expect new cyclical lows in bond yields for example, and as we have long mentioned, Australian 10-years are already taking out the 1.81% lows. Structurally speaking, I also expect a much weaker USD over the course of the year. The world needs a weaker USD to flourish and what the world needs, it tends to eventually get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s also worth noting that while we are not far from all-time highs in US equity indices, we have already seen new all-time highs in certain stocks, Shanghai at around 3,100 is still around 40% lower than its 2015 high of 5,180. We also have huge China equity inclusions in the MSCI EM index coming that will take us from 5% to 20% (in +5% increments slated for May, August and November. The bounce in Chinese equities is likely telling us that, for now at least, we’ve seen the worst in the underlying Chinese economy and could be in for some positive surprises, particularly in Q2’19 growth data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds – Why sovereign bonds are Q2’s investor favourites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first quarter of 2019 saw a U-turn in central bank policy. With data pointing to a global slowdown, policymakers do not wish to take chances. Saxo believes that is why we have seen the Federal Reserve stall its rate hike plans, the European Central Bank commit to whatever support measures are needed and the People’s Bank of China push stimulus in the form of fiscal policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Althea Spinozzi, Bonds Specialist, added: “We believe that this global policy panic will play in favour of global sovereigns. Credit spreads will also be supported, but investors should remember that dovish central bank policies may prolong the late-cycle period. They will not, however, be sufficient to entirely avoid the recession we believe is coming in Q4’19 or early 2020. This means that while credit valuations will be supported for longer, credit risk will remain very high; in this context, investors should stay cautious and avoid picking up unnecessary risk, especially in the high-yield and emerging market spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The global policy panic sparked by the December selloffs has seen the Fed turn away from quantitative tightening and its own rate hike schedule. A dovish Fed is good news for bond investors even amid muted economic growth. Treasuries will gain from the unconditional support even though if it is now clear that recession is coming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macro – A reality check for the euro area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large declines in core European industrial production data can be observed, especially in Germany, which accounts for one-third of European industrial activity. This slowdown came as a shock for many policymakers, but Saxo feels that it was predictable. Over recent quarters, leading indicators - notably credit impulse - led us to warn clients and investors against the risk of lower growth in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As economic data will continue to disappoint in the coming months, Saxo believes that a new consensus for looser fiscal policy will emerge in European countries in H2’19. An accumulation of negative German data could be the perfect trigger to set off expansionary fiscal policy in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Dembik, Head of Macroeconomic Analysis, said: “We see growing risks to growth in the periphery of the euro area and expect that Germany will experience disappointing growth this year. The outcome is likely to be more fiscal expansion after the EU parliamentary elections and further monetary stimulus in a tricky period for the ECB as it will be looking for its next president.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macro – Debt financed spending versus rising populism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Trump and the China-US trade war to Brexit and the gilets jaunes, the threats of this regime shift are evident. The tectonic plates are shifting, even if we are yet to feel the consequences of the extremist versions of these movements, like a hard Brexit. After a 30-year spate of deregulation and laissez-faire economics, this new paradigm will create a different business and investment environment and the implications will be far-reaching, creating fresh headwinds and therefore risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleanor Creagh, Market Strategist, commented: “As the backlash intensifies, so will the battleground, making it increasingly difficult to price risk and determine the policy response against a complicated and polarising backdrop. Aside from reactive or palliative redistribution policies, any response that will bring real improvement and tackle the misfortunes of those caught on the wrong side of globalisation seems a long way off. The current new political era is the result of decades of societal shifts and the solution could itself take decades to work though.” &lt;/p&gt;
