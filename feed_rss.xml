This model has fittingly been called an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO), and although the first cases took place back in 2017 (Bread, Gifto) the trend didn’t really take off until the beginning of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, an IEO is the same crowdfunding process as an ICO is, except that the project which issues the tokens and desires to raise capital relies on exchange to perform crowdsale rather than doing it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binance pioneered this tokensale method with multiple huge successes on Binance Launchpad, inspiring other market participants to begin developing their own IEO platforms as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the present time we can count at least 15 exchanges which have either started supporting IEOs or announced that they are developing an IEO concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s go ahead and look at&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive list of exchanges with IEO platforms/launchpads:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://launchpad.binance.com/"&gt;Binance Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*4HYhCrdGNgQkfr1zJxboWA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Binance Launchpad&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pioneering IEO platform, started operation in 2017 and became mainstream in 2019. A lot of successful cases including &lt;strong&gt;Bread&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gifto&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bittorent&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Celer&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Fetch &lt;/strong&gt;and one upcoming called &lt;strong&gt;Maric&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.huobi.com"&gt;Huobi Prime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*wsiY33plg-xFgbWOlaEGeA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Huobi Prime&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huobi was actually the next major exchange after Binance which managed to perform successful &lt;a href="https://cryptopotato.com/breaking-huobi-prime-completes-its-first-ieo-of-top-network-price-surges-250-immediately/"&gt;IEO with the TOP Network project&lt;/a&gt;. They completed their first selective token sale event in a matter of seconds, with token prices surging by 250% immediately afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.okex.com/lang/en-US/"&gt;OKEx Jumpsmart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*Mi3T6X2NBxvpK5hSI_dZoQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;OKEx Jumpsmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the leading exchanges by trade volume, it’s no surprise that OKEx doesn’t want to be left out of the IEO trend. To ensure that they stay relevant, they’ve &lt;a href="https://www.chepicap.com/en/news/8147/okex-to-launch-platform-similar-to-binance-launchpad-ok-jumpstart-soon.html"&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;their own IEO platform, called &lt;strong&gt;OK Jumpsmart&lt;/strong&gt;. So far there isn’t any public information about upcoming projects, but we can be sure that they are looking closely for new prospective projects to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.coineal.com/ieo.html#en_US"&gt;Coineal Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*ffUYliBFHLztSKtVmoIvuQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Coineal Launchpad&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coineal is quite a big exchange with almost $700M daily trading volume and they’ve already jumped on the IEO train with their own Launchpad. Among already completed cases they have &lt;strong&gt;IPW Token&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Levolution&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Kizuna Global Token&lt;/strong&gt;.

Although they have been &lt;a href="https://blog.cer.live/investigations/the-best-practices-of-zb-com-used-by-zbg-com-using-fake-volume-instead-of-marketing/"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; of faking their trade volumes, nevertheless, ZBG has completed two IEOs on their own launchpad with &lt;strong&gt;V Systems&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Kamari&lt;/strong&gt; projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.bw.com/TLP"&gt;BW Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*9X5kSXAR9cWV26dMITm5tA.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;BW.com Launchpad&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;BW.com is a core strategic partner of ZB.com exchange, a deeply-rooted crypto-exchange in the Asian market. BW Tokens Launchpad has supported three IEO projects to date, with two of them completed in the end of March 2019 (&lt;strong&gt;Blockbuster &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;V Systems&lt;/strong&gt;) and one still ongoing (&lt;strong&gt;Grabity&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.coinbene.com"&gt;Coinbene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*n9SAYSAAi6OG0LlTJq95mA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Coinbene Launchpad&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coinbene was noticed talking about their own IEO platform already in 2018, but the first IEO launch was officially &lt;a href="https://www.thedailychain.com/blog/komodo-backed-project-redfox-labs-to-run-ieo-on-coinbene/"&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;in March 2019. Since Coinbene is often listed among the Top 10 exchanges and has a big community, we might expect another successful case in IEO field from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://bgogo.com"&gt;BGOGO Apollo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*mmE882VWY_R1VL_AwQLqog.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;BGOGO Apollo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;BGOGO is the first digital asset exchange with supernode listing authority.

Their first IEO project called &lt;strong&gt;DOS Network&lt;/strong&gt; hasn’t done much to excite the community, and already there’s a sense that these projects may struggle to sustain their price once exchange listed. It’s early days for Bitmax Launchpad though, which may yet produce some winners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;11. &lt;a href="https://international.bittrex.com/"&gt;Bittrex International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*tGrasXVeNXym9fhNU8T0nA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bittrex International&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-established and popular exchange, Bittrex, announced their first IEO in February 2019. But the first and so far only IEO — for &lt;strong&gt;RAID &lt;/strong&gt;project — was cancelled. Nevertheless, Bittrex is expected to pursue another IEO in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.probit.com/en-us/ieo"&gt;Probit Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*qu-857PKWO8Lv8R70MvgxA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Probit Launchpad&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probit is not one of the major exchanges by trade volume, but they are seeking to distinguish themselves from other small-scale exchanges proliferating the market with their IEO support. There have been quite a few IEO cases hosted on their website already, but they were completed without nearly as much buzz as the Binance cases had. Among them: &lt;strong&gt;Spin Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;CharS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Wegen&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Steemhunt &lt;/strong&gt;and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;13. &lt;a href="https://latoken.com"&gt;Latoken Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*UjC6LYInJUeg9sx19WXIfA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Latoken Launchpad&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latoken started their IEO launchpad a long time ago back in 2018 and have actively promotedthe projects listed on their platform. Just recently they &lt;a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/pr-7eleven-launches-ieo-on-latoken-exchange/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new IEO for the &lt;strong&gt;7Eleven &lt;/strong&gt;project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.kucoin.com"&gt;KuCoin Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*iY_oDJkmXOxFQqPiIMHlvQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;KuCoin Spotlight&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;KuCoin is a former Top 10 exchange which have lost their position due to decreased trading volume of late. Nevertheless, they remain one of the best-known exchanges worldwide. Recently they &lt;a href="https://www.kucoin.com/news/en-token-sale-of-multivac-of-kucoin-spotlight-will-start-on-april-3rd"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their first IEO for the &lt;strong&gt;MultiVac &lt;/strong&gt;project on their brand new platform, called Spotlight, which will take place in April 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;15. &lt;a href="https://exmarkets.com/launchpad"&gt;Exmarkets Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*XuEQzHH8FIuhSBokUSfdLA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Exmarkets Launchpad&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExMarkets platform is a new generation crypto-exchange providing thick order books and deep liquidity thanks to a backend framework.

So far there have been two completed cases — their own tokensale of the Cobinhood token and another project called CyberMiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This list is assembled after studying IEO market during recent months and will be expanding with time.

The current stage of blockchain and cryptocurrency development is most analogous to the Internet Revolution in 1994, in which we have invented TCP/IP, HTML, and FTP, and out of these will lead to the development of &lt;em&gt;Netscape&lt;/em&gt; (1994) and much later &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt; (2004), and &lt;em&gt;Airbnb&lt;/em&gt; (2008). In blockchain, we are still inventing the building blocks and tools that allow us to distribute compute, preserve privacy, manage identity, and allow scalability, etc. — the breakthrough dapps have yet appeared and will emerge in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-ePFxCDpfvH6K61iXl3T4w.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Perez Technological Surge Cycle from Technology Revolutions and Financial Capital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the negative press during this cryptocurrency market downturn, we are still early in the industry, and the bubble came prematurely due to 1) The possibility of early liquidity with tokens despite the fact that a lot of the products and technologies were not released 2) The world is a lot more connected now, thanks to the Internet and social media, which could have accelerated the propagation of hype and formation of the bubble globally in a way that wasn’t possible before. However from a technological perspective, we are still in the “gestation” phase in the &lt;em&gt;Perez Technological Surge Cycle, &lt;/em&gt;and the “installation” period has yet appeared because the previous market frenzy didn’t produce the outcomes that are necessary to reach a turning point, which include “significant infrastructure improvements and replicable business models that can serve as a roadmap during the deployment period” (check out this great &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-blockchain-differs-from-traditional-technology-life-cycles-95f0deabdf85"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/bc483fae50b4"&gt;Daniel Heyman&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dxf8SKZ5bbX3GYkDxnwlrw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Growth of Internet users vs Growth Projection of Cryptocurrency Users in the World&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current user adoption of cryptocurrency is most similar to the adoption of the Internet in 1994, in which 24 years later, more than half of the population on the planet live their daily life connected. We can expect a similar growth trajectory happen in the cryptocurrency space, perhaps at a faster rate since the world is more connected now and there’s a general trend for new technologies to be adopted at a faster pace over the past centuries. For example, it took 46 years for electricity, 35 years for telephone, 14 years for TV and 7 years for the Web to reach 25% of global market penetration. Therefore, we estimate that it could take another 15 years for cryptocurrency to reach the level of adoption that we have today with the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a capital perspective, the magnitude of the fundings invested during the Internet and Blockchain Revolutions is also very different, with $35.6B of venture capital flowing into US Internet startups in 1999 (according to &lt;em&gt;CNN Money&lt;/em&gt;) versus $1B of venture capital and $5B from ICOs going into global blockchain companies in 2017 (according to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/914088e570e"&gt;CB Insights&lt;/a&gt;). At the peak of the Internet bubble in 2000, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/3aaaf6f9eea"&gt;Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt; had a market cap of $6.5T (inflation-adjusted) compared to a global market cap of $800B in cryptocurrency in early 2018. Despite the fact that the Internet bubble only took place in the United States, while the cryptocurrency bubble was global, the former had a higher magnitude of capital invested because 1) The Internet bull run was coupled with the existing long term stock bull run, in which Wall Street and the retail investors were already “warmed up” to jump into the new high returns dot com IPOs 2) A large amount of capital came from the accumulated wealth of baby boomers, who were around their 40s, managing their own retirement savings, and not familiar with economic crisis during their life. In contrast, the cryptocurrency investors were mostly dominated by Millennials who had less capital than the older generations (Millennials: 41%, Generation X: 24%, Baby Boomers: 18%). Additionally, the amount of capital invested in cryptocurrencies from institutional investors was relatively small and didn’t include the participation of countries with large populations, such as China and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_OukpBsiiI_8kpCYXl1qWw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Blockchain Revolution: the evolution of the market, technologies, and companies&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From these perspectives, we should expect another bubble or bubbles to appear in the years to come, as “successful and replicable business models” (&lt;em&gt;Carlota Perez&lt;/em&gt;) will be found in decentralized applications, with a larger magnitude of institutional capital flowing into the industry, similar to what happened during the Internet Revolution in 1999–2000. We can expect the total market cap to eventually surpass $10T as it would combine protocol tokens (which capture value from dapps), equity tokens, utility tokens (if the model still proves to be viable in the future), and cryptocurrency (as a store of value — in which &lt;em&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/em&gt; could reach a market of $7.8T if it reaches the equivalence of digital gold). Overall, we believe that we are still early in the technological cycle of Blockchain, similar to 1994 during the Internet Revolution and we should expect more market cycle or cycles happen in the upcoming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What to Expect Next? :&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*NlmK3Z5dxlFMGBdA" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consensus 2018: Debate around the adoption of decentralized applications between Joseph Lubin, Founder of ConSensys and Jimmy Song, Venture Partner at Blockchain Capital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this current market downturn, the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries need some winning use cases to re-instill confidence in the tech. After the Internet bubble had burst, people were gradually willing to believe in Internet again as a new wave of web startups started to find their footing, and the successes of &lt;em&gt;Netflix&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PayPal &lt;/em&gt;began to reduce some of the uncertainties and bad memories. In the cryptocurrency and blockchain world, we are still looking for successful use cases that can prove the value blockchain technology and decentralized applications to help the industry regain confidence. One of the prominent leader in the dapp development space and founder of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/6c7078bf7b01"&gt;ConsenSys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/6a370863659c"&gt;Joseph Lubin&lt;/a&gt;, recently claimed that “peeking into 2019, if you could see the landscape through my eyes, you’d have to wear shades”. &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/6a370863659c"&gt;Joseph Lubin&lt;/a&gt; takes a strong position that the future will be decentralized, while other figures such as &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/4acb12744ff8"&gt;Jimmy Song&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/9737c5ab2ab1"&gt;Blockchain Capital&lt;/a&gt; remain skeptical around the decentralized applications being used in the upcoming years. So far, the unicorns in the space are centralized companies with traditional business models that benefit the cryptocurrency ecosystem itself (&lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/367181b93908"&gt;COINBASE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/57600910a883"&gt;Binance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/d7b292505fc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Bitmain)&lt;/em&gt;. We have yet seen popular decentralized applications that are replacing traditional companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CJdQNSoZ4W5YSWsEN6ttqw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The previous and future phases of the Blockchain Revolution&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are currently transitioning into the fifth phase of the Blockchain evolution, in which the application of Blockchain across different industries, and Blockchain scalability solutions are being explored. During the first phase, between 2009–2012, Bitcoin was released as a new type of digital currency and proof-of-concept, and the first users were composed of hardcore techies, cryptographers, and cypherpunks, who were mining and promoting cryptocurrency in various mailing lists and forums (&lt;em&gt;bitcointalk.org&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Reddit&lt;/em&gt;, etc.). During the second phase 2013–2014, with the increasing media coverage (although many of them were negative press), infrastructures such as exchanges, wallet, custody, and payment solutions started to increase. The third phase 2015–2017 was more focused on real-world applications around financial use cases, such as remittance, micro-payments, cross border payments. With the emergence of smart contracts with &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/d626b3859bc9"&gt;ethereum&lt;/a&gt;, we have entered the fourth phase in which use cases beyond finance are being explored, and the new fundraising vehicle, ICO, became a killer application during this phase. In the fifth phase, we are expecting the emergence of successful dapps and use cases, reinstalling confidence about the technology, and improvements in blockchain scalability, privacy, data storage, interoperability, custody and user experience. Much later in the sixth phase, we are expecting to see dapps disrupt and compete against centralized monopolies such as &lt;em&gt;Dropbox, Facebook, Youtube, Airbnb,&lt;/em&gt; etc., allowing consumers to participate and gain more power in the digital economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a side note, successful dapps could take some time to be rolled out because the decentralized application ecosystem received a lot less capital than protocols. During the Internet bubble, most of the capital fundings went into building applications (&lt;em&gt;Yahoo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Netscape&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; eBay&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Amazon,&lt;/em&gt; etc.) while the protocol developers (TCP/IP, HTML, FTP) were researchers who got paid almost nothing and non-profit organizations often handled the subsequent iterations of the technology. However, in the blockchain space, we have witnessed the opposite in which the majority of the capital went into private companies that handled the protocol development (&lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/d626b3859bc9"&gt;ethereum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/95d056302ecb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NEO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/97957d5f5ab2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ICON&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Ontology/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/4998f4ed133f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ontology Team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; etc.) and a lot of the blockchain tools did not have access to capital from ICOs. The disproportional amount of funding could slow down the overall development and release of decentralized applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lnzGMpCPGvjrEwV06oEPjw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Crossing the Chasm, a term created by Geoffrey Moore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, in terms of global adoption, the adopters of cryptocurrency and blockchain remain within the 2.5% “Innovators” bracket. To put into perspective, there are about 4B users of the Internet, which in which we are entering the “Late Majority” phase of the adoption. The next Blockchain bubble could bring in the “Early Adopters” of cryptocurrency and the “Chasm” could be crossed with the help of large consumer-facing corporation (&lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/dec5a8211dd1"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Facebook, Walmart&lt;/em&gt;, etc), and financial institutions (&lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/3a8b739a08d1"&gt;Fidelity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/3aaaf6f9eea"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nasdaq&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Goldman Sachs&lt;/em&gt;, etc), who are already starting to explore opportunities and have an existing large user base and an influential reach to more traditional players. For instance, &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt; is currently working on a solution that could allow for stablecoins payment on its messaging app &lt;em&gt;Whatsapp&lt;/em&gt;. The potential for the company to make a move in financial services is very large, with more than 200 million users, and a large user base in India (which leads the world in remittances — people sent $69 billion home to India in 2017 according to the World Bank said this year). We have also seen recent announcements from &lt;em&gt;Samsung&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;HTC&lt;/em&gt;, who are already evolving their hardware and preparing for the next wave of adoption by introducing built-in cryptocurrency wallets in the &lt;em&gt;Galaxy S10&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Exodus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we have seen a shift of mentality on the institutional side, notably with the participation of endowments such &lt;em&gt;Harvard, MIT, Yale&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dartmouth&lt;/em&gt; universities, who are starting to invest into the cryptocurrency space and recently, &lt;em&gt;Cambridge Associates&lt;/em&gt;, a leading pension and endowment consultant advising on almost $400 billion capital, beginning to recommend their clients to consider investing long term on the digital asset space. Moreover, a recent project &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/36ab36b72f19"&gt;Bakkt&lt;/a&gt;, created by the &lt;em&gt;Intercontinental Exchange&lt;/em&gt;’s (ICE), an operator of several global exchanges including the &lt;em&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/em&gt;, just raised over $182.5M in funding to enable consumers and institutions to buy, sell, store and spend digital assets. Such initiatives will further drive the global adoption of cryptocurrency from the institutional side, helping bridge the adoption chasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sum, we are still early in the technological cycle of Blockchain, similar to 1994 during the Internet Revolution, and we expect more bubbles with bigger capital flowing towards the dapps ecosystem. Additionally, we expect to see more dapps being released in the upcoming years, in which some of them will become breakthrough projects, gradually re-installing more confidence in the space. Large corporations and financial institutions are starting to get more and more involved in the space, and have the potential of bringing a large crowd of consumers and investors, helping bridge the adoption chasm and opening doors for mass adoption. We remain bullish on the development of the industry and are excited to see what will come into the in the upcoming years. This concludes our article series about the Internet vs Blockchain revolutions and hope we provided you some valuable perspectives and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;____&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet Revolution facts are based on the book &lt;em&gt;“How the Internet Happened”&lt;/em&gt;, written by &lt;em&gt;Brian McCullough&lt;/em&gt;. Mark Twain once said, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme”. We are attempting to draw some similarities between the Internet and Blockchain Revolutions, to help entrepreneurs and investors better understand technological life cycles. Please leave your thoughts and comments below, and hope this article series will have provided some valuable perspectives about the Blockchain industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author: Remi Gai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How the Internet Happened”&lt;/em&gt;, written by &lt;em&gt;Brian McCullough&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pijR8vrQphk"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pijR8vrQphk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ethereumJoseph/status/1076171159853502464"&gt;https://twitter.com/ethereumJoseph/status/1076171159853502464&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mccannatron/12-graphs-that-show-just-how-early-the-cryptocurrency-market-is-653a4b8b2720"&gt;https://medium.com/@mccannatron/12-graphs-that-show-just-how-early-the-cryptocurrency-market-is-653a4b8b2720&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-21/facebook-is-said-to-develop-stablecoin-for-whatsapp-transfers"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-21/facebook-is-said-to-develop-stablecoin-for-whatsapp-transfers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2000/02/14/cashflow/survey/"&gt;https://money.cnn.com/2000/02/14/cashflow/survey/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://diar.co/volume-2-issue-39/"&gt;https://diar.co/volume-2-issue-39/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/blockchain-vc-ico-funding/"&gt;https://www.cbinsights.com/research/blockchain-vc-ico-funding/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Internet-users-in-the-world-from-1993-to-2014-As-on-1-st-July-2014_fig1_292251717"&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Internet-users-in-the-world-from-1993-to-2014-As-on-1-st-July-2014_fig1_292251717&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_97/journal/vol2/kaa2/"&gt;http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_97/journal/vol2/kaa2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/"&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/4/20/5624018/should-technology-define-generations"&gt;https://www.vox.com/2014/4/20/5624018/should-technology-define-generations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18233131/samsung-galaxy-s10-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-wallet-features"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18233131/samsung-galaxy-s10-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-wallet-features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ccn.com/breaking-harvard-stanford-mit-have-all-invested-in-cryptocurrency-funds"&gt;https://www.ccn.com/breaking-harvard-stanford-mit-have-all-invested-in-cryptocurrency-funds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fupscri.be%2Fdde502%3Fas_embed%3Dtrue&amp;amp;dntp=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fupscri.be%2Fhackernoon%2F&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fucarecdn.com%2F57662ddc-da7c-407b-afcb-cb45184b2705%2F&amp;amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=upscri" width="800" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/3c851dac986ab6dbb2d1aaa91205a8eb/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/3c851dac986ab6dbb2d1aaa91205a8eb/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=170562d7229" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/internet-vs-blockchain-revolution-are-we-in-1994-what-to-expect-next-part-5-170562d7229"&gt;Internet vs Blockchain Revolution: Are we in 1994?

are a series of interviews featuring various important voices and perspectives in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Each interviewee was carefully selected and asked the same group of questions. The main goal was to provide the world with a collection of commentary and opinions on the state of the current Bitcoin and crypto market. Some of the names you will recognize while others don’t wish for the limelight but have great insight and experience we all can learn from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These interviews are raw and unfiltered with no agenda other than giving each individual their opportunity to speak their mind. If you like what you see, please share with your friends. If something offends you, you should probably X out and find another crypto fluff piece that gives you warm fuzzies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vortex is a long time Bitcoiner and founder of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocastnet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;@cryptocastnet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Most people know him from his successful podcast &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPj3KCksGbSYHFmduDw4fyKe8H5fEZ6Be"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bitcoin News Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*TO2PUKbBSSdX0LPGw_9WdA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theonevortex"&gt;Vortex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country:&lt;/strong&gt; USA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do people know you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m known usually for one of three things, my twitter account, my youtube show/channel and for my involvement with promoting the UASF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been into Bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first got into bitcoin in 2012, started investing around 2013, started commenting on bitcoin in 2014 on coindesk, then started commenting on it on twitter in 2015 and in that same year started my youtube show The Bitcoin News Show on The World Crypto Network youtube channel in the fall of 2015, and finally started my own youtube channel about Bitcoin last year in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Bitcoin experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting bitcoiners in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worst Bitcoin experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting bitcoiners in real life. No just kidding. The most stressful experience was by far the UASF in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think is Bitcoin’s biggest threat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments and central banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on the various Bitcoin forks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimentation is great, through this experimentation we learned bitcoin forks are just alt-coins and bitcoin doesn’t compete with alt coins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you optimistic about in this space?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The privacy tech being used in the space such as Lightning and Coinjoining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biggest regret during the last bull market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting too cocky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have you learned during the current bear market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing for me is to see old bitcoiners go and new bitcoiners come to take their place, most cases for the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the biggest fail you have seen during the bear market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Pham. No just kidding. I think it’s not such a fail, as I don’t often look at the negative, if I do it’s only to reveal the positive that is always there, and for me it’s that people are realizing more and more that bitcoin doesn’t compete with alt coins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think helped trigger the current bear market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty natural correction. It’s hilarious to see some people blame the futures and options market, they had very very little liquidity. It was healthy and natural correction. Speaking in TA terms we should have never gotten much higher than 7k but of course bitcoin is the only truly free market so it will over correct in both directions. Bitcoin continues to repeat the same patterns it always has, now with greater and greater value attached to each of the 21 million coins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of damage do you think latest price drop has done to buyer sentiment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None. At least none to those with an actual understanding of risk and an investment horizon of longer than 3–5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about the current state and future of lightning network?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s going amazing. To be honest I never thought it would move this fast. Solving problems one by one. Gaining traction one CEO of a major social media company at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on HODLing Bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People seem to have forgotten what the term saving means in this age of easy money and endless Q.E. My thoughts are as they always are, save what you can and only spend what you must. The rest goes from practicality to philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you thoughts on alt-coins?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of like asking a Gold Bug what he thinks about penny stocks. There is some interesting things happening that may or may not come to serve various market needs. Personally I’m here to steal the fire from the Gods, to change the way we think about money itself, to provide an option outside the only financial system we’ve been forced to use for over a millenia that has enslaved, slaughtered and starved millions of people. These are the end days. This is where humanity chooses enslavement or freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you hold any? If not, why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well after that last ridiculous answer does it really matter? But seriously. I do not give financial advice and I’ve only ever advised people to buy and hold bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of impact do you think the radical drop in alt-coins will have on their future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts on the notion of bitcoinization?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s inevitable. The only variable is time. We can debate that variable at length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Bitcoin startups are you excited about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I’m excited about projects and technology, not companies so much. Things like Cyphernode from BullBitcoin, NBitcoin from Nicolas Dorier, Lightning Loop from Lightning Labs, Schnorr signatures are all examples of just some of the amazing technologies I’m super excited about. Some projects I’m excited about are BTCPay server which is an open source payment processor for merchants, Wassabi wallet from Adam Fiscor which uses coinjoining by default, Samurai wallet which is implementing a bunch of interesting privacy features at the transaction layer, Zap wallet from Jack Mallers which is a beautiful lightning wallet which has merchant features in beta right now, really there’s just too much to list here. Bitcoin is booming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What “crypto influencers” do you think get it wrong and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate this word with the burning of a 1000 suns. I won’t comment much on people I’d prefer to comment on ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What “crypto influencer” do you think get it right and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s it going to take for this bear market to turn around?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How bullish are you on Bitcoin despite this recent pullback?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is simply repeating its natural cycles. This is a healthy pull back and still 4x what we were in January of 2017. Bitcoin essentially creates a never ending cup and handle pattern on the charts when you zoom out on the log chart. This is 5th abstraction of money, the first digital monetary system born on the internet outside of the state, and the best form of money humanity has ever seen. Every 50 years or so global monetary policy shifts dramatically but only suffers its effects decades later. With endless Q.E., negative interest rates, and the endless corruption, it’s simply a matter of time before the market truly discovers bitcoin, and discover it, it will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any tips you want to give to people new to Bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do your own research, put in the time, but make sure it’s proportionate to your investment. If you only put in $100, then only do $100 worth of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best tips for storing Bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger, but I like to recommend the Cold Card wallet for those interested in preserving their financial sovereignty .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name some of your favorite information sources and/or podcasts in the space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many to name but if you go to the Crypto Cast Network youtube channel you’ll see we have a list of featured channels there. And if you go to my twitter account you’ll see my public Bitcoin list of people to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any last words of wisdom?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in very interesting times. A time of revolution, a time of hyper personalization, a time of misinformation. We now live in an age when you can believe whatever you want and have it re-enforced and reflected back to you exactly how you want it. Take care to do the hard work it takes to discover the truth. In an information age the ability to find signal over noise is paramount, it will be the only way you succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/@piratebeachbum"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay tuned for the next Bear Market Bitcoin Diaries.

&lt;div&gt;Cyber threat intelligence has gained a lot of recognition over the last five years in the UAE. While some businesses have taken proactive measures by protecting sensitive data and training their employees in cybersecurity protocols, others in the country and the region are failing on their basic cyber protection strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 274 cyber attacks were reported in the first seven months of 2017 in the UAE, targeting both government and private entities, according to data released by the Telecommunications Regulations Authority.  A survey conducted by Mimecast and Vanson-Bourne showed that although 69 percent of UAE respondents agreed on the importance of cyber threat intelligence, about 32 percent of businesses in the UAE are not even using a firewall gateway for basic information security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I know there's a big debate about what the basics of security practice are, but I don't think anybody would argue that having a firewall at your perimeter is something that you should not have. This is a bit of a scary number - that almost a third of people here do not have a firewall set up ... However, if you look back five years ago, cyber threat intelligence was focused on the largest organizations in the world, the large financial services, the large government state actors. If you ask folks today, 75 percent have implemented some level of threat intelligence, and the other 25 percent are interested in doing it over the course of the next year. So it's a monumental shift of folks saying, 'I don't really know what it is', to saying, 'I think I need to do it too' ..." said Marc French, Senior Vice President and Chief Trust Officer of Mimecast, one of the top email and data security companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French, Chief Trust Officer of Mimecast, spoke to AMEinfo in an exclusive interview and shared his thoughts on major cyber risks for businesses, impact of innovations on cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threats facing small businesses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French: So I think the threat is one of resourcing, more than anything else. I think the perception is that you're always going to have somebody coming after you - everybody recognizes that. However, what I've seen - from a threat actor perspective - is that everyone's a target. This was not true before. But now, with the weaponization of 'crimeware as a service', it's so much easier for them to go down the stack with respect to business weaponization. So what happens is, is that you've got all of these smaller businesses, which weren't necessarily a target now becoming targets, while the really big organizations have gotten really hard to get into. Criminals are motivated by money - if they can do a bunch of small ones versus one big one, that will be just as good for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proactive protection strategies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French: I think intelligence is one of the things that's a feeder into a proactive position. Lean on your vendors more than anything else to help you with that. If you think about email, as an example, I would say most people have an email environment, whether they're hosting or are running it. Probably a quarter of them have no way to actually recognize the threats that are in their environment. That's when you rely on someone like Mimecast to come in and say I have an intelligence team; I should be providing you that data to help you in your protective strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortage of cyber-skilled professionals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French:  I think at the top, there's still a shortage of security experts. You see it here in the Middle East; we see it in the States and in Europe as well. There's just not enough folks coming in - and it is part of my job as a senior security leader to bring up that next generation. So I mentor about 40 high-school and college students to actually get them interested in security. And it's beholden to us as security experts to make sure that we do that because the colleges aren't going to do it for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good strategy to have, in my opinion, would be 'force multiplication'. You're never going to train everybody in your organization to be a security expert, but you should train everybody to have a certain amount of security awareness. So if you raise the bar up just a little bit, you'll see the amount of potential breach drop. 100 percent of employees in an organization will tell you that they have done some kind of awareness training, but what we find is that a third or less actually do continuous training. That's another the thing that Mimecast is bringing to the table - continuous awareness training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French:  I think it's going to be absolutely critical to scale. There's no way that you can have human intervention in intelligence generation anymore. I mean, most state-sponsored intelligence agencies use a combination of AI and ML, and that's going to trickle down into the private sector. You need to have that machine learning to actually crunch the numbers. We do millions of emails; I don't have millions of folks in my intelligence team looking at all the data. I need ML and AI and that infrastructure to do some of that base correlation. And then, for higher order, humans get involved to take a look at that and then re-adapt the algorithm to go forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of trepidation about letting the machine do the remediation. There's a conversation going on about people losing jobs to AI and ML and it's not unique to the U.S. It's a conversation in the EU and it's the same conversation here. I would tell you, that it is not really a true statement. There's a security innovation landscape that's looking for really smart people that are going to hire people right out of college, or right out of their apprenticeship program. So what I've seen in our area is that innovation is driving the next generation. There will always be higher order jobs that will need human intervention. Folks will need to learn new skills and move with innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeship is probably the best thing. Because that can come at any stage in life. Most people in the States do their degree in university right after they get out of secondary school, and then ever go back. I'm advocating for apprenticeship programs throughout your lifespan. We do that now with veterans that come out of the military; we do it for older adults that want career changes. If they have the aptitude, and the willingness to learn, I'm going to hire that person, because I can train them to do any one or number of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact of 5G&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French:  5G does raise concerns about the proliferation of your attack surface. 5G is going to allow for much more connectivity then you've ever seen in the past. It also takes the conversation to how much more connected the human is going to be with respect to that. So now 5G, when it comes to wearables, is an interesting conversation as well. Also, think about augmented reality in a 5G world, you can kind of do it. Think about an augmented reality situation where I need to find my way down to the World Trade Center in Dubai and I can see that virtually on my phone or through my glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now think about that, from a security perspective. So what if I could hijack the stream there and direct you to a place that you shouldn't go. So there's always an angle. The more connections I have, the more technology I'm going to introduce, the more likelihood for someone to actually monetize that from a crimeware perspective. If you look at 5G, it just opens up the opportunity to inject more kit into the environment, which means more real-time connections; which means that I'm going to have more access to data that I need to protect. So this goes back to the ML-AI perspective. Today, if you're going to ask me if humans can do that work - they absolutely can't do that work. So without AI and ML, we are not prepared at all to face the threats that innovations that 5G are bringing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is outstripping cybersecurity. It's just the reality. This has happened in the past with innovation outstripping the security side. Tactically, what I'd probably do is focus on response detection and response in the short term, knowing that the adversaries are probably going to be ahead of me out of the gate. So, my blue team is going to be right on their tail getting up to speed while you make sure you can identify telemetry, do some kind of detection, and you've got a good response by compartmentalization. There are a whole bunch of ways that we can do it. In that time, ML catches back up. And then we'll be in the race that we are today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That’s the disruptive power of this technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a developer, you know the limits and the potential of a modern computer, however, when it comes to quantum computations, nothing is the same. The common way of storing information on bits in the form of a 0 or 1 can now be 0 and 1 at the same time with quantum computing. That’s the quantum effect and it’s the first thing you should learn when diving into this field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information might be hard to digest at first, but once it’s properly explained, everything will start making so much sense. If you don’t want to be like everybody else, running away from quantum computing just because it “sounds” difficult, I urge you to get your feet wet with the following list of hand-picked resources on quantum technology to learn about its true potential!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1) &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/quantum-computing-an-overview/"&gt;Quantum Computing — An Overview at Udemy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detailed overview of quantum computing covering entanglement, superposition, quantum gates, superdense coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Explained-David-McMahon/dp/0470096993"&gt;Quantum Computing Explained at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversational approach to explaining quantum computing with workable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3) &lt;a href="https://geekforge.io/"&gt;Daily email list of quantum computing coding tasks from GeekForge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can solve tasks independently or discuss them with the community.

                &lt;br&gt;In today’s fast moving data ecosystems, getting the right insights in time can be as hard as filling a cup from a fire hydrant. The only intelligent way to achieve bottom-line results from data is to be equipped with data analytics capabilities. Data analytics tools have been around for decades and they have evolved from simple Excel spreadsheet analysis of the 1990s to advanced predictive analytics solutions post-2010s. Analytics algorithms &amp;amp;amp; tools are still evolving, and the new wave of development &amp;amp;amp; acceptance of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are making the market more promising. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), global spending on big data and business analytics will grow from nearly $122 billion in 2015 to $187 billion in 2019. Dan Vesset – Group Vice President, Analytics &amp;amp;amp; Information Management at IDC, said, “Organizations able to take advantage of the new generation of...&lt;br/&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2019 14:56:00 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>AMEinfo: TOP CEO 2019: Figuring out business growth amid a volatile future -  Puntaje: 5200</title><link>https://ameinfo.com/trending/top-ceo-2019-future-of-growth-volatile-future/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="150" height="150" src="https://ameinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/180411_0415_JRT_8954_optimized-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" srcset="https://ameinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/180411_0415_JRT_8954_optimized-150x150.jpg 150w, https://ameinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/180411_0415_JRT_8954_optimized-200x200.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The 5th edition of the Top CEO Awards, organised by TRENDS magazine and leading international business school INSEAD, will celebrate the region’s best-performing CEOs from companies that are listed on the stock exchanges of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman. The event will be hosted in Al Areen Palace &amp;amp; SPA in Bahrain on April 11th, 2019 uniting some of the region's most successful and trendsetting CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's theme, "Growth in a Volatile Future," will shed light on the Middle East's dynamic but volatile region. Oil price fluctuations, tech disruptions, as well as armed and political schisms affect businesses posing new challenges, risks, and opportunities. The Top CEO 2019 Thought Leadership Conference aims to find growth solutions amid these numerous challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, and leading up to the Awards ceremony itself, guests will be able to attend multiple panels on all aspects of growth in the region, and the issues affecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_1382055" align="alignnone" width="770"] A panel that took place at the 4th edition of the Top CEO Awards in 2018.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Opening Keynote will address digital transformation in the finance sector, providing insights on the next steps for the region to become a Fintech Hub. It will be presented by Jassim Alseddiqi, CEO of Abu Dhabi Financial Group (ADFG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first panel will bring together 5 notable CEOs and will explore the myriad of ways the GCC can equip itself to face the challenges related to global and regional economic volatility, under the title "Future of Growth Amid Volatility."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a region with a major expat population, there has been never a more important time to talk about diversity and inclusion. In the UAE alone, expats represent 88.52% of the population, according to Global Media Insights. The "Promoting Diversity in the Middle East and North Africa" panel will shed light on the importance of inclusion and diversity in the business world, marked by the launch of The Diversity Council MENA, a diversity &amp;amp; inclusion accelerator, by Nordic consultancy Above &amp;amp; Beyond Group, and in partnership with Mediaquest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women as well play a role in diversity initiatives. When Saudi permitted women to drive in the Kingdom last year, Bloomberg Economics forecast a $90 billion boost to Saudi economic output by 2030 as a result. "The Future of Women Business Leadership" will address this and more, with the participation of Lamah Al-Khayyal, Head of Saudi Aramco Driving Center; Paolo Gallo Author, International Speaker and Executive Coach; Dr. Maliha Hashmi, Executive Director, NEOM; and Elham Yousry Mahfouz, CEO, Commercial Bank of Kuwait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCC governments take center stage with the panels "Bahrain’s Growth Dynamics," "Cost Cutting, Profit Risks and Government Spending" and "Do Structural Reforms Attract Direct Investments?" With economic diversification plans such as Bahrain 2030 and Saudi Vision 2030 in full effect, GCC governments are taking conscious efforts to future-proof their countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_1382070" align="alignnone" width="1000"] Manama, Bahrain[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't talk about the future of business without mentioning technological innovation. The panels "The Blockchain Opportunity" and "The Human Factor and Tech Innovation" will bring together industry experts from Facebook, the Bahrain FinTech Bay, and King Abdulaziz University to discuss these topics. Bahrain is positioning itself to become the GCC's go-to tech hub, through legislation such as allowing 100% foreign ownership of businesses, even outside free zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award ceremony will follow starting at 7:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Artificial intelligence and machine learning are about to change the way we learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent Forbes Coaches Council report comprising firsthand insights from top business leaders around the globe show that, as certain roles begin to be phased out we are likely to see new roles emerge. This will require people to continuously learn, adapt, and incorporate new learning into their daily lives if they want to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study conducted by the Boston University School of Law and initially published in the Harvard Business Review comprising of data collected over 16 years from 36,000 firms in the Netherlands and covering about 5 million workers each year, shows that highly-paid workers are more commonly affected than low-paid workers by the introduction or expansion of automation. However, the repercussions of automation are more severe on the lives of those low-paid workers that are affected by automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although automation does not always equate with mass layoffs or over-the-top fears of plant closures, spikes in automation correspond to the loss of earnings and work, the study shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is corroborated by recent research conducted by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which states that 14 percent of jobs performed by humans are vulnerable while another 32 percent of jobs will see workers need significant upskilling or reskilling due to automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upskilling an aging population&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While automation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are on the cusp of changing the globe, the average number of people over the age of 80 has increased sevenfold. A study by the World Health Organization (WHO) on global aging and health shows that for the first time in history, the world will have more humans over the age of 65 than those under the age of five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could the combination of emerging digital and social trends mean for the way older generations learn and work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “long-term” solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifelong learning is not an option anymore; it’s quickly becoming a necessity as workers strive to stay relevant. Whether it is employers investing in upskilling their employees through internal training, educators constantly challenging the boundaries of full-time and distance education, or organizations investing in smart solutions to cut costs and increase efficiency – there are plenty of innovations reshaping the traditional education template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, online learning and an improvement in educational technology is not in itself the answer. There is a need for hybrid long-term solutions, that combine online learning with face-to-face interaction a Barclays “Beyond 100: Whitepaper” indicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that while the global workforce will need to accommodate and adapt to automation and machine learning, there could be new opportunities available for older workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurship, there are now more new entrepreneurs in the U.S. above the age of 45 (51 percent) than those under the age of 45. Also, the proportion of new entrepreneurs age 55 to 64 has increased from 15 percent to 26 percent between 1996 and 2016, while new entrepreneurs between the ages of 20 to 34 have considerably decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The traditional three-stage life – learning in childhood and adolescence, working throughout adulthood and spending our older years in retirement – could be completely redefined by the next generation,” the Barclays whitepaper states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A longer, healthy life could mean that people can switch between learning and working in a more flexible manner. It also means that the global workforce could be shaped by freelancers and flexible workers of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In the annual TOP CEO ranking, which identifies the Top 100 out of more than 700 listed companies on the GCC stock markets, 22 are listed on the UAE stock exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these 22 UAE-listed companies is among the top 10 in the 10 different categories. Top 10 CEOs will be awarded in 10 categories, bringing the total number of awardees to 100. There are seven from Bahrain, 31 from Saudi Arabia, 24 from Kuwait and 16 from Oman who made to the shortlist of the Top 100 in 2019. The rankings are based on financial performance and good corporate governance in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our region is going through a digital transformation and is embracing the Fourth Industrial Revolution at a rapid pace. Despite global and regional challenges, there are several green shoots when it comes to reforms, innovation, entrepreneurship, women leadership, and digitization. In this context, the Top CEO Conference and Awards will highlight and discuss new business models, collaborative economic eco-systems, disruptive leadership, the impact of new technologies and innovative growth strategies,” said Alexandre Hawari, Co-CEO of Mediaquest – the company behind the Top CEO Conference and Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Growth in a Volatile Future'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organized by the Dubai-headquartered multi-dimensional media firm Mediaquest, the Top CEO Conference and Awards is going to Bahrain for its fifth edition on April 11, 2019, at Al Areen Palace and Spa, where business leaders, and more than 30 expert speakers from across the region and the world, will gather to discuss various topics weaved around the central theme of “Growth in a Volatile Future”, while also recognizing the very best in business leadership. Last year the event was held in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights of the Thought Leadership Conference will be a Keynote Address by world-renowned academic and economist Professor Nouriel Roubini from New York University's Stern School of Business. Prof. Roubini’s views on global recession and crypto-currencies have caught headlines across the world. He will speak on the Pillars of Building Strong Knowledge Economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In order to highlight the importance of concepts such as design thinking and decision-making, the Conference will bring regional context to global challenges,” Alexandre Hawari said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Awards in 2019 have evolved and a significant change is being introduced without altering the brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of just 100 CEOs from all sectors of listed companies, we have introduced 10 categories that are most prevalent across the GCC stock markets,” Alexandre Hawari said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandre Hawari, Co-CEO, MediaquestAwards Evening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Top CEO Awards, organized by TRENDS magazine and INSEAD, the leading international business school, are designed to honor the region’s top 100 CEOs from publicly-listed companies in a credible and transparent process based on hard facts such as growth, profitability, size and corporate governance. Hawkamah Institute for Corporate Governance supports the event to ensure that corporate governance and disclosure criteria are strictly adhered to as a part of the ranking.  Global auditor KPMG ascertains data consistency and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award winners will be announced on April 11 evening as a fitting conclusion to the Top CEO Conference and Awards. For the fifth edition of the TOP 100 CEOs, the group has decided to introduce 10 categories. After discussing with its stakeholders and without touching the DNA of the TOP CEO ranking, Mediaquest is introducing 10 awards in 10 categories. The categories are based on the key business sectors under which the companies are listed on the GCC stock markets. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-Top 10 Banking Companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-Top 10 Financial Services and Investment Companies&lt;/p&gt;

Keynote Speakers&lt;br /&gt;
1. PROF. NOURIEL ROUBINI – RENOWNED AMERICAN ECONOMIST AND AUTHOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof of Economics at New York University’s Stern School of Business, Nouriel Roubini is a renowned American economist who predicted the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. In late 2018, he co-authored an article published by Project-Syndicate.org entitled 'The Makings of a 2020 Recession and Financial Crisis' where he says: “Come 2020, the stage will be set for another downturn – and, unlike in 2008, governments will lack the policy tools to manage it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forbes wrote that his research on emerging markets makes him an expert on speculative bubbles of all sorts. He is bearish on Cryptocurrencies. Forbes quoted him as saying: “Bitcoin is not money. To be money it would need to be a unit of account, means of payment, and a stable source of value and purchasing power. Bitcoin is none of these. Other cryptos are worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Roubini has extensive policy experience as well as broad academic credentials. He was Co-Founder and Chairman of Roubini Global Economics from 2005-16 – a firm whose website was named one of the best economics web resources by BusinessWeek, Forbes, the Wall Street Journal and the Economist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are among numerous other prominent public and private institutions that draw upon his advisory expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

ADFG investment in Shuaa Capital repositioned the Dubai-based financial services provider as a key player in the region’s financial sector in 2017, when it netted just over $20 million in profits.&lt;/p&gt;
