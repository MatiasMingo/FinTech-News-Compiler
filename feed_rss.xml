It is also leading the blockchain gaming market — My Crypto Heros (MCH), since it is launched in Q4 2018, MCH has become the largest blockchain game in the world with over 17,000+ users on the main net. And the local community are also catching up quickly — big gaming companies, game studios, and indie developers have joined the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did Japan become the leader of blockchain gaming? &lt;a href="https://www.dapp.com/"&gt;Dapp.com&lt;/a&gt; took a deep dive in Tokyo with a mission to find out the secret and meet with the major builders and players for decentralized apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Identifying the Huge Opportunities of Blockchain Gaming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ownership and liquidity of virtual items are the current problems,” said Tran Ngoc Son, the CEO of &lt;a href="https://tomochain.com/"&gt;TomoChain&lt;/a&gt; Japan. According to Tran, blockchain in gaming opens new territory for developers since:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blockchain in gaming enables interoperable profiles of players and game virtual items;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cryptocurrency enables in-game economics-incentive mechanism;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blockchain-based games allow players to truly own their in-game assets and greater control over their favorite games.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players can collaborate with developers to improve a game on the blockchain. In the case of TomoChain, developers or game companies can make mobile friendly games by using TomoWallet dapp browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GJVkoYi6zl10W-Woy34djw.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tran Ngoc Son&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gen Kanai, Director of strategic partnerships at &lt;a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/"&gt;Animoca Brands&lt;/a&gt; addressed, “As Japan is one of the top gaming markets and is quickly adopting blockchain into gaming, we can see numerous games in development today which we hope to enjoy later this year. We are happy to see the interest in &lt;a href="https://www.sandbox.game/"&gt;The Sandbox&lt;/a&gt; and look forward to expanding the blockchain gaming community with this and our future games in development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AUt9gIedctonqmK5sOzT4w.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gen Kanai&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overcoming the Usability Challenges: Gas Fee, UX, and Scalability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shunsuke Watanabe from &lt;a href="https://mycryptoheroes.net/"&gt;My Crypto Heroes&lt;/a&gt; opened his presentation about the challenges the team was facing during the game development. “When you build a dapp, you have to deal with blockchain related UX difficulties, such as gas fee, scalability, transaction times, and so on”, said Shunsuke, “the thing that blockchain games compete with ‘normal’ social games is usability.” He continues explained that if we want real user adoption, we need to get to the level of current browser / mobile games, while adding the positive aspects of blockchain gaming: Ownership of assets, the democratization of revenues, interoperability of items, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yW77_Sm-4uSM7H73sHPjRg.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Shunsuke&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shunsuke mentioned that their team solved the Ethereum related UX challenges as follow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1- Battle-system beta runs on a side-chain to avoid the gas fees and long transaction times, and also provide a smoother game flow. The hybrid on-chain / off-chain infrastructure was crafted by the MCH team and it connects a gateway in-between — to ensure a trust-less gaming experience, which is true ownership of assets and scarcity of heroes and extensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2- An Ethereum proxy API that built and implemented by the team to speed up the data transmission significantly and smooth a better user experience ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Users want a pleasant game experience that is comparable to ‘normal’ games while enjoying the benefits of Blockchain. It is our task as a developer to build systems that enable good UX while securing our user’s assets on the blockchain”, said Shunsuke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Facilitating the Decentralized Ecosystem: Tools and Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nana H.Tanaka, the country manager at&lt;a href="https://pundix.com/"&gt; Pundi X Labs&lt;/a&gt; Japan talked about how PundiX Ecosystem Facilitates Dapps. He introduced XPOS’ main function to allow payment as well as allows anyone to buy ETH. XPOS will certainly solve one of the major pain points for people to start using a dapp, which is helping people to get crypto as easy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taisuke Horitsugi, the Evangelist at &lt;a href="https://kyber.network/"&gt;Kyber Network&lt;/a&gt; Japan told audiences about how Kyber tackles the issue of in-game transactions and provides an on-chain protocol that provides liquidity to dapps.

Since our first idea validation round was very positive, it was time for us to get validation from people outside our network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vyw1Vae7YIREh4ldEpBSyw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Achieved — Page Views&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our efforts, we managed to attract 1,000 unique visitors in a month and converted 10% of them into potential beta testers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, this has been to most exciting and challenging phase so far. I had to start from a blank page with a major difficulty: to not disclose our real name and use an alias — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getachieved"&gt;Mister Hat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;style&gt;body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Achievedai" target="_blank" title="Twitter profile for @Achievedai"&gt;@Achievedai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/quuu_co" target="_blank" title="Twitter profile for @quuu_co"&gt;@quuu_co&lt;/a&gt; I definitely like the idea of being able to easily and clearly celebrate and recognise achievements every day. This is vital when managing a remote team, it&amp;#39;s often overlooked to provide public feedback for high achievements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200a;&amp;mdash;&amp;#x200a;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewSpurr/status/1095982671652626432"&gt;@MatthewSpurr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey &amp;&amp; donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height); resized = true;}if (parent &amp;&amp; parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location &amp;&amp; window.location.hash === "#amp=1" &amp;&amp; window.parent &amp;&amp; window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit &amp;&amp; window.webkit.messageHandlers &amp;&amp; window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;if (parent &amp;&amp; parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  &lt; maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Define Personas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step was to identify potential buyers. From our research we identified two main personas we could easily target online:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business owners and managers convinced about the benefits of alignment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We initially restricted this to people who are publicly talking about OKR (Objective &amp;amp; Key Results). The main reason is that our solution aimed to support OKR initiative and this keyword is easy to isolate in a search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People, and ideally managers of teams, working remotely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This second persona was selected for the same reasons. The community of remote workers keeps increasing, and there’s a lot of online communities. So, it’s easy to target them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these two profiles, I’ve particularly targeted tech-savvy people interested in testing new solutions. That’s why I’ve narrowed down the reach to startups/SME or tech/product profiles in larger organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also researched to better understand what would attract these people the most, and what kind of messages would have the most impact. I would summarize my findings in a few keywords: &lt;strong&gt;transparency, opinion, support, give, expertise, share, and fun.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phase is crucial, and you should take a lot of time to read and observe before you begin marketing and growth activities. You definitely don’t want to waste time creating generic content which would end up generating very little traffic. You should also target less than three personas to make sure you can easily track which one drives better results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Channels, Account Setups and Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on my research on personas, I was able to quickly identify the key social media platforms where I could find my targets. For efficiency, I decided to limit my activities to a few sites:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beta platforms / startup listings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of places where to index a platform and get traffic from beta lovers. Some websites refer more than 1,000 of them. I only registered for a few. The most efficient platforms, so far, have been: &lt;a href="https://betalist.com/startups/achieved"&gt;Betalist&lt;/a&gt;, Betabound, Launchfeed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*C0NcskA-xgKtvShxyuneKg.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Achieved on Betalist&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, again, decided to focus on the two platforms where my personas would be the easiest to target, LinkedIn and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter was certainly the toughest, as people there are looking for real people vs. an alias to engage with and, on top of that, you must stand out of the crowd. Creating a new identity on Twitter requires a lot of work and engagement with the audience. But when well done, it really helps build a responsive audience, collect rapid feedback and drive qualitative traffic. Essentially, the goal on Twitter is to build your reputation, show your expertise and engage with market influence to benefit from their captive audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn was a bit easier as I got the chance to recycle a company page from another dead project. I changed the description, ULR, name and visual aesthetic and tada! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NnWxAXwQMNkEr3_Jdy1Ozw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Achieved impressions on LinkedIn&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, that’s the easy part. It turns out that page content isn’t very prioritised by LinkedIn algorithms and I suspect this to be even worse when a page has been “sleeping” for a while. Generally speaking, the engagement rate on content on LinkedIn is quite low. On this platform, I didn’t create an account for Mister Hat, it wouldn’t make sense as aliases, and fake accounts are not very welcome by the community. Also, it would have been quite cumbersome to create a complete and attractive profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last channel type I chose to focus on was the community. That’s indeed integral when it comes to targeting a certain persona, but it’s also the most time-consuming. Entering a community requires being accepted, to learn its code and to contribute a lot. Yet, that’s also where you can capture the most qualitative audience. As we’re big fans of the open startup community, we’ve decided to focus first on Makers related communities: &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@achievedai"&gt;ProductHunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/achieved"&gt;IndieHackers&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Maker’s Kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goals in these communities has been to engage with other great Makers to learn from them and support them in their own initiatives. Next, I focused on getting feedback on what we’re building and, consequently, built our brand awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Track and Optimise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting traffic is good, but being able to analyse it and then reproduce the magic is better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our first month, it was important for us to experiment and analyse what source provided the most high-quality of traffic. Our statement was simple, if we engage with the right audience and if they visit our website, we’ll immediately know if it’s worth coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the first 1,000 visitors, we managed to convince 100 of them to register with our wait-list. 💪&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the second step is to deep dive into the analytics to know where the traffic is coming from, what they paid attention on the platform and were their actions before their registration. That’s where it got messy… :-/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the month, we decided to shift from &lt;a href="http://www.achieved.ai"&gt;www.achieved.ai&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.getachieved.com,"&gt;www.getachieved.com,&lt;/a&gt; and we forgot to change a setting. Unfortunately, this caused us to miss a consequent amount of “event” in our goal tracking. Fortunately, this was something we were able to easily consolidate thanks to our contact list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second and bigger mistake we made was not being systematic in adding a source or a reference when we were referencing our website. Around 75% of our traffic comes from direct access to the website. This means that we were unable to know the source of 75% of our traffic. As a consequence, our optimisations for next month were very limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we’ve learned from this mistake, we’re much more systematic when it comes to traffic tracking. 😄&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though getting 1,000 unique visitors with 0€ spent and only few hours of work is great, it is just the beginning. Our primary goal for the next few months is to keep increasing our exposure and build a significant user base to kickstart our beta. We will also improve our own practice to avoid untracked links, and we’ll keep testing other techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this blog was focused on the technique we used, the next one will probably focus on the tools behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please give a shoutout if you have any questions or feedback on what we do! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Liked what you read!? 👏&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hit the CLAP 👏 button + Share on Twitter!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me here on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Achievedai"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/achievedai"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; on productivity hacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=77f0810994d3" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-i-got-my-first-1-000-visitors-in-a-month-77f0810994d3"&gt;How I got my first 1,000 visitors in a month&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 14:34:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Finovate: Taulia Upgrades with AI -  Puntaje: 600</title><link>https://finovate.com/taulia-adds-ai-upgrades/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Alternative supply chain financing company Taulia announced this week it is tapping into AI to boost its platform&amp;#8217;s Working Capital, Invoicing, and Intelligent Platform programs.
