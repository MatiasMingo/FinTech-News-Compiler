&lt;div&gt;Cloud computing provides better data storage, security, flexibility, and increased collaboration between employees,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud adoption streamlines the workflow of small businesses and large enterprises to help them make better decisions at lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gartner forecasts that the cloud services market will grow 17.3% in 2019 ($206.2 billion) and by 2022, 90% of organizations will be using cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many prominent providers make the right promises but often under deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who Do You Use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud is the market leading cloud solutions brand, based on current usage or consideration, according to the results from a survey undertaken by the Financial Times (FT), as reported by Statista.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, upon examination of the unaided or unprompted cloud solutions for business that come to mind among the global FT audience, Amazon/AWS emerges as the leading brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amazon has seen a significant rise since 2016, surpassing the equivalent growth of both Microsoft and Google,” said the FT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_1381127" align="alignnone" width="960"] Courtesy of Statista.com[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;73% of businesses feel positive with the cloud service they use, however concerns still exist around cybersecurity and the cloud ecosystem, reports FT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feelings regarding cloud solutions do vary greatly based on factors such as tenure of cloud implementation, size of the organization and the number of cloud solutions used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“9 out of 10 businesses experience a broad range of problems within their first 6 months of implementation, and beyond 6 months, 75% experience persisting complications. These issues include the lack of internal customer expertise and the management of multiple cloud services; however, issues also vary across regions and organizational size,” said FT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS perhaps the best&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud infrastructure business catering to other enterprises, has quickly grown from a smaller side business to a billion-dollar success and the main driver of Amazon’s profit, according to Statista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Q4 2018, Amazon’s cloud arm generated $7.4 billion in revenue and accounted for nearly 60% of the company’s $3.8 billion operating profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Statista.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to estimates from research company Canalys, AWS captured 32% of global cloud infrastructure spending in 2018, with its largest competitors Microsoft, Google, Alibaba and IBM sharing 33% of the $80 billion market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;By Keith Tully, Partner, Real Business Rescue, UK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of fintech has created a ripple in the financial services industry and continues to disrupt the market following the emergence of advanced online banking services and the growing use of cryptocurrency. As the traditional face of the finance sector embraces technology, fintech enhances and closely replaces existing financial services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fintech is being embraced and developed by the likes of banking institutions such as Barclays, collective start-ups and specialist hubs established to spearhead fintech businesses into the banking sector. The use of new fintech is snowballing and overtakes traditional banking services as budding start-ups introduce industry-changing technology to the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), a leading financial hub for the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, is backing the vision of fintech start-ups and entrepreneurs which are shaping the future of the financial sector. The aim of the DIFC is to reduce the costs associated with innovation by pooling resources and to accelerate the speed of development in order to create opportunities for banks, therefore boosting profitability. By encouraging the growth of investment into fintech businesses, the banking sector continues to explode with new ideas in relation to process management, automation, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking reimagined with fintech &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of fintech in the banking sector compliments establishments with financial technology, revolutionizing the way customers interact with banks. As users now follow a ‘mobile first’ approach and adapt to a faster pace of living, investment in online banking is vital, creating an ideal opportunity for your business. Fintech disrupts infrastructure for the better, as by automating certain aspects of the customer journey, manual labor is reduced and made instantaneous for the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banking integrated with fintech has been inspired by the likes of Revolut, a challenger bank which gives access to cheaper foreign exchange rates with 0% fees on international transfers through an app. The online bank which is a partially crowdfunded venture allows you to trade in Bitcoin and other similar currencies. The digital bank now has over three million customers and the company is worth over $1.7 billion. This is a reflection of the increasing demand for fintech integration in daily banking services. As a result, mainstream banks are digitizing their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns commonly associated with fintech include security risks, hacks and data breaches as they are not bound by the same rules as banking institutions. Growing concerns mount around the need for stricter regulation without posing unnecessary barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report by Fintech Hive, part of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the largest fintech accelerator in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia found that fintech businesses increased nine-fold from 91 in 2010, to 839 in 2017, showing an increasing demand for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurtech &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurtech is essentially insurance companies embracing tech by streamlining the process with automation, artificial intelligence and removing IT barriers, such as unfit-for-purpose legacy software and archaic software infrastructure which decelerates the customer journey. Intelligent use of fintech reduces manual work and encourages automation to speed up the customer process. Internal checks are complex and lengthy which typically contribute to poor customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smaller scale example of this is telematics insurance which is the installation of GPS analytics software which transmits information to the insurance provider, including driver style and habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic Fintech &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic financial technology is rising in the ranks as sharia-compliant financing options are expected to be worth $3.8 trillion by 2022, according to Reuters. Islamic banking as such makes it permissible to integrate closely with halal businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALGO Bahrain, the world's first Fintech Consortium of Islamic Banks, including Al Baraka Banking Group, Kuwait Finance House (KFH) Bahrain and Bahrain Development Bank (BDB) is the incubator for Islamic finance. ALGO Bahrain aims to launch 15 Fintech platforms by 2022 by offering a cost-effective solution which allows for research and innovation to be executed at an accelerated speed. By offering a specialist service to a Muslim client base, you are able to expand your market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated Chatbots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of chatbots in the financial services industry follows the likes of Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa.  During the launch of a pilot scheme in 2016, Middle Eastern bank, Emirates NBS, launched an automated chatbot, Amelia, to digitally interact with customers. If questions cannot be answered by Amelia, these are passed on to human operators, similar to the chat assistant used by UK banking provider, NatWest, named Cora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated chatbots add a conversational factor to banking and reduce the amount of time manually spent by human operators to answer customer queries.  This is an exclusive service which can encourage customer loyalty and open up to a wider market, thanks to the explosion of vast and wonderful fintech services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Coded Minds, a Dubai-based education technology firm, has announced the closing of its latest round of funding from a single investor, Alarabi Investments. Alarabi Investments has become a significant minority shareholder in Coded Minds Limited, therefore, valuing Coded Minds at AED 40 million with this round of funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coded Minds, which is licensed by the KHDA, offers a variety of modernized project-based courses taught across the UAE’s private and public schools. It has developed a disruptive business model that is expected to change the dynamics of the education sector. This new approach is expected to capitalize on the relatively younger population of GCC countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is our mandate to invest in the next generation’s disruptive businesses with mass scalability in the GCC and beyond. Education especially iSTEAM fits perfectly in our agenda,” said Mohammad Alghaith, CEO of Alarabi Investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The education technology company not only provides technology-focused and integrated courses but also is on a mission to bring about a revolution in the education sector in the classroom and beyond through the implementation of technology and a revolutionary business model. Coded Minds is also planning to expand into Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are committed to forming new education paradigms for our children, in order to equip them with the right skills and prepare them for future challenges. This partnership will allow Coded Minds to not only execute on its UAE expansion plans but also to further enter into Saudi Arabia as a key market immediately while continuing to develop and enhance our course offerings” said Omar Farooqui, Founder and Chief Innovation Officer of Coded Minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based in Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) since March 2018, Alarabi Investments aims to deliver change, value, and impact through investment in prospective opportunities. This investment is the company’s second, after successfully investing in a Saudi healthcare startup that is powered by artificial intelligence, also a disruptive business model and the first of its kind in the region. The fund is geared toward supporting Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
