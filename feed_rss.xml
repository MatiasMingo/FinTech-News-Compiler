&lt;div&gt;The word "disruptor" has been thrown around a lot over the past few years, but few innovations have fit the bill the way blockchain intends to. From modifying concepts of identities to adding trust and transparency in the peer-to-peer space, the pace of the blockchain revolution and its potential has gone far beyond the "bitcoin technology" that it is known to be.&lt;br /&gt;
Neil Ginns, Senior Solutions Consultant at nCipher, spoke exclusively to AMEinfo about his viewpoints on the impact of the blockchain tech, its potential uses, challenges facing its implementation and the need to take a deeper look into the security surrounding this innovation.&lt;br /&gt;
"Blockchain has the most impact in terms of recording data - and those sectors that are recording data that can't be tampered with will benefit. Blockchain will impact healthcare, national records, land registration - anywhere where you've got information that needs to be put in an electronic form and there isn't necessarily a central authority that could regulate it," Neil Ginns said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "blockchain" solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Ginns: Blockchain has a lot of used cases that shows it will change things. However, it's early days. People are trying it in a lot of different ways. In some ways, it's not going to be the solution for a particular set of problems, so those will be troubles in themselves. Yet, overall it's a technology that solves problems in a way that other technology doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have methods of establishing trust in finance. They are very centralized. We have central banks; we have big payment cards like Visa and MasterCard - so for those type of solutions, blockchain doesn't really add much value because we already have a central point of reference. Where blockchain does add value is in the peer-to-peer space where you don't have central authority; where you need to have different individuals, different organizations being able to communicate with each other in a trustworthy way without relying on a central point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges facing blockchain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Ginns: The first big challenge that blockchain faces is credibility. It's very easy for people to knock blockchain by citing lots of used-cases that failed. They can find a lot of overinflated expectations. But at the same time, there are success stories. There are people who have made it work for them, and used blockchain to do things that they couldn't do before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second challenge that blockchain faces is around security. For those people who jump in and use this technology and haven't learned from the past, they are likely to make mistakes. The challenges that blockchain faces are around the keys. Blockchain relies on using cryptography, which has keys. These keys are literally worth money. They are the value of the data. In cryptocurrency, they are worth money, and in other types of blockchain use, they are the value of the data that they are protecting. If you protect your data with keys, you then need to protect your keys. Cryptography solves your data protection problem, but then you've got the problem of protecting your keys. That's where nCipher focuses on - making sure we protect valuable encryption keys, which are then protecting valuable data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a generation before people have the skills to protect blockchain. In the blockchain world, things are moving faster than the skills needed to protect the keys and data. While blockchain is rather new, protecting data isn't new. We've used encryption to protect data for many years, and we need to use the past as our reference for the present and don't the same mistakes that people made in the past, just because blockchain is new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain and cybersecurity threats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Ginns: In the field of security, you're always catching up. There's always the bad guys; there's always the threat. It's like an arms race. As technology changes, there are new attacks; there are new ways in which security can be compromised, and there are also new defenses to block those attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threats that people perceive - they are not the bad guys; they are not the hackers sitting in a basement in another country. The No.1 threat that people are worried about is employees making mistakes. People who have access to your valuable data, who make a mistake by putting it in the wrong place; leaving the door open and making a mistake that compromises sensitive data accidentally. Second, are the temporary workers. People coming in to do some work for you; they have access to the data - and they may either make a mistake or choose to steal that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Ginns: The change we are seeing globally, but also specifically in the Middle East, is cloud computing. This completely changes things. Up until this year, there were no major cloud providers in the Middle East. This year both Microsoft and Amazon are opening cloud services in the UAE and Bahrain and that changes the way people use their IT resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, rather than having to buy all this equipment, they can take advantage of the economies of scale and even if they are a small business, they can share infrastructure with thousands of other customers of cloud providers who are hosting and making things much more efficient. Their cost, therefore, also turns into subscription rather than an upfront cost, and as a growing company, their use of resources can be much more tightly controlled and aligned to what they actually need. They don't have to buy an overcapacity at the start, they can scale up as time goes on. But at the same time, when you are using the cloud, you also are using someone else's resources; someone else's computers; someone else's infrastructure; and somebody else's employees are managing it. You have to make sure that you keep control of the security of that data yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Simply put, NFTs are blockchain based tokens that represent digital assets, allowing them to exhibit unique traits, become counterfeit proof, and be tracked on a consensus based decentralized ledger. We’ve seen standards arise for NFTs on platforms like the Ethereum blockchain, through the Bitcoin / Counterparty extensions, and with Tron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On EOS, the &lt;a href="http://hub.pixeos.one"&gt;pixEOS&lt;/a&gt; team is busy working with our partners in the &lt;a href="https://dgoods.org"&gt;dGoods&lt;/a&gt; initiative, rolling out the standards for the NFT protocols of the future. While the code behind NFTs is hashed out, pixEOS is creating what will be a vibrant ecosystem for gamers, artists, developers, and collectors that will harness the true potential of NFT enabled commerce. I want to take some time to talk a bit more about pixEOS, and why I think it has the potential to revolutionize the world of art, collecting, and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*LmtcjHwsmAC-tbDKv8GxSw.gif" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="http://hub.pixeos.one"&gt;The pixEOS hub.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pixeos.io/"&gt;pixEOS&lt;/a&gt; is changing the EOS ecosystem, the art world, gaming and the cryptocurrency ecosphere as a whole. Our flagship decentralized application, or dApp, is named &lt;a href="http://paint.pixeos.art/"&gt;pixEOS Paint&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an interactive digital canvas, built on the EOS blockchain. We’ve implemented a staking and profit sharing tokenomic system into the canvas, and that’s just the beginning. This canvas represents the nascent phase of development for an NFT protocol that will enable other facets of the pixEOS platform, including our Art Gallery, Art House, Auction House, Personal Canvases, and a series of upcoming games reliant on NFT based assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately pixEOS will provide all inhabitants of the EOS ecosystem a means to generate their own NFTs substantiating the art they create or submit to the platform. In addition, pixEOS will open up a global marketplace, allowing for the purchase, sale, and transfer of digital assets represented by NFTs. These NFTS will fall in line with standards which are set to be adopted universally across the ecosystem, thanks to our active participation with the &lt;a href="https://dgoods.org/"&gt;dGoods&lt;/a&gt; digital standards initiative. As such, blockchain backed entries for NFTS substantiating art will eliminate any questions over provenance, and smart contract powered exchanges of ownership will cut any costs extracted from users by third party transfer fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a marketplace for NFTs and tackling art provenance is a small part of the larger pixEOS vision. pixEOS has built a reward based token staking economy that hinges on the redistribution of a percentage of platform volume to participants who stake their PIXEOS Tokens. Right now, the pixEOS Paint dApp represents the first of such pixEOS platform elements from which volume is allocated to platform stakers. We will expand this reward system to encompass the volume from other facets of the platform as they go live. The reward system will eventually be tied to the Art House and Auction House marketplace proceeds as well as direct sales from NFTs from Galleries, and additional games that we will be introducing to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8eA1vj5w3yOdNKZAANttUQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Fabi Yamada.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Driving Forward Mass Adoption For Crypto&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that we believe really drives adoption is ease of use, which is why we’ve partnered with a number of major players in the EOS ecosystem including many of the major wallet service providers. We did this so to maximize ease of use when it comes to interacting with the family of pixEOS dApps. For example with pixEOS Paint, we engineered the dApp to work on both mobile and desktop platforms, so as many people could access the game as possible. On our side, the UX/UI developers are close to releasing an amazing new front end, allowing our community to navigate between different facets of the pixEOS platform in a &lt;a href="https://hub.pixeos.one"&gt;futuristic cyber-metropolis&lt;/a&gt; that expands and evolves as we add more features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned briefly earlier, pixEOS is also working closely with the &lt;a href="https://dgoods.org/"&gt;dGoods&lt;/a&gt; initiative to standardize NFT protocols across the EOS ecosystem which will create opportunities for interoperability between dApps which will bring more options to users when developers embrace the way dApps can interface with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to onboard as many people as possible to EOS as we can, so the team has been providing newcomers to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology free EOS accounts (with some practical vetting to safeguard against abuse.) This is a commitment the team has made; we want to ensure everyone who needs an EOS account has one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ubZo22Km3_xNFMSar5ayoA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Stellabelle.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Developing At The Speed Of Blockchain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our team has been burning the midnight oil in order to bring an entire platform live in less than 2 months. Our engineers are quite gifted, and over the course of development our team’s innovative approach solved an issue surrounding history nodes, a solution which can be applied by other EOS developers. Because we’ve got such talented individuals, the only constraining factor we have is time; we need time to be able to roll out the additional iterations of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having stated this however, if you check out the team’s recent progress and history of achieving our goals you’ll see we haven’t disappointed; pixEOS is in it for the long haul and we’re delivering in the short term as well. In a relatively short time his team has built an entire community from nothing, ran a successful fundraise during bear market conditions, created a dApp from the ground up and went live in less than 2 months, deployed a staking protocol on the EOS main net, built meaningful connections across the entire ecosystem and has also joined the dGoods initiative to stratify the NFT protocol for other dApps to follow in our footsteps across the EOS ecosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason we’ve succeeded in developing so rapidly can be attributed to EOS itself. As a platform, EOS simply has the architecture, governance, ease of use, and reliability we need. On top of that, the sheer positive energy of the EOS community is an enormous factor on productivity. We believe that EOS can currently scale to properly handle the potential that the pixEOS platform has to offer without presenting the kind of transaction processing issues and subsequent high fees that have made it impractical to use blockchain based networks. In addition, when proper security practices are followed EOS provides an extremely secure environment in which to develop; considering the fact that so much is at stake, we find that to be both comforting, and paramount to our decision to carry out our work on the EOS blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found a unique opportunity in EOS; people wanted a creative outlet, and after many projects had seemed to harness this and then fizzle away into vapor, we wanted to contribute something that would deliver this to users in a lasting and meaningful way that wouldn’t just go up in smoke. It was literally a wing and a prayer that put us in this position; we found something for which there was an overwhelming demand, and then we set out to deliver it. We were very lucky to get the support of block producers early on, and that sort of snowballed when people began to grasp the true nature of the idea behind pixEOS, and the potential it has to revolutionize the worlds of art and gaming forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LpeILt8DDc86T2M9OGQVBw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Yusaymon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building Value Within The Platform&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than focus on the extracting value from the ecosystem that provided the building blocks for the platform, we’ve doubled down on building value into pixEOS. This will enrich EOS in turn, and it will be a means for everyone to engage in activities and commerce, whether they’re casual or competitive gamers, artists, or collectors. We have accounts for a myriad of different factors with staking and redistribution system that drives the pixEOS profit-sharing engine, which is meant to ensure the longevity of the token. Ultimately we’re going to be establishing fiat-gates for our pixEOS Store, allowing for the exchange of PIXEOS Tokens for goods from the shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the road to building a strong token, pixEOS has made strategic allegiances with several block producers in the EOS ecosystem. We believe that by engaging in outreach and working with others towards similar goals we can all achieve more. In that vein, we’ve been able to thrive thanks to our partnerships that have expanded the scope and influence of the pixEOS platform in order to expand and bring amazing art and opportunities to a growing community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know that it takes feedback and input from multiple individuals to properly fine tune a user driven platform like pixEOS. From that basis we have always kept an ear to the community, and when push comes to shove, we listen and try to make the best decision for everyone. We realize that without the community we serve the project wouldn’t exist in the first place. We appreciate the feedback and interaction we have with everyone who reaches out to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;pixEOS is fundamentally based on profit-sharing, and that’s why our unique staking system drives back a percentage of all volume back to the participants on the platform. To give back to the community to which we owe so much, we literally want to spread the wealth around. It’s our way of showing you all that we’re dedicated to the idea of a rising tide that lifts all boats; our success is yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZgsXhIMLF923RGhzHMFa3A.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Joe Chiappetta.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Right Place At The Right Time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were very lucky to have access to a team of assertive people from the beginning. As we continued to grow and set loftier goals, our team began to grow. It was sort of a law of attraction situation; the right people came to us at the right time and things just came together. I think this speaks to the blockchain industry in general; so many people are interested in working on something and building something new and amazing. Our team happens to be rich in these types of individuals, and the outpouring of community support that we’ve seen has been, at times, overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As creators who are building with a burgeoning technology, we have the advantage of developing alongside other amazing teams who are also trying to drive practical tools to the ecosystem. This creates an enormous opportunity for partnership building towards interoperability between dApps in a thriving environment. Blockchain technology is driving forward a sort of creative environment where we have seen a growing potential and opportunities for startups, and pixEOS was lucky enough to harness that and flesh it out into an amazing project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t already, check out pixEOS paint, paint something amazing, mint some PIXEOS Tokens, and start staking them to earn rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jT_NnxuhTxhLzwoUwLNBxg.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5629a9146a0f" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-potential-of-pixeos-5629a9146a0f"&gt;The Potential of pixEOS&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2019 17:51:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cointelegraph: SFOX Market Index Reads Current Crypto Market as ‘Mildly Bullish’ -

You have a general understanding of the API landscape, but might not have known the power of using Shrimpy to manage all of your exchange API connections. Keep reading!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll be showing you how to set up cryptocurrency trading using APIs. This process can be repeated for every major exchange due to the universal developer tools provided by Shrimpy. The alternative being libraries like CCXT, which require you to write custom code for every exchange, manage infrastructure, and scale a farm of servers which executes trades and collects data across every exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.shrimpy.io/blog/shrimpy-vs-ccxt-centralization-in-a-decentralized-ecosystem"&gt;Shrimpy vs CCXT: The Case for Centralization in a Decentralized Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create &amp;amp; Connect your API Key&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we guide you through the steps of API trading, you will need to create exchange API Keys. Detailed instructions on how to generate exchange API keys can be found &lt;a href="https://help.shrimpy.io/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ShrimpyApp/linking-bittrex-api-keys-tutorial-8657c779c9f4"&gt;Linking Bittrex API Keys [Tutorial]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shrimpy Crypto Trading API&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mDew5oCkO0TTwvgJbDZLYg.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shrimpy Universal Crypto Exchange APIs connect to every major exchange. This provides a unified interface to interact with exchanges. Instead of learning the quirks and unique issues of every individual exchange, the Shrimpy Developer APIs can be used to prevent these irregularities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of managing user API keys and connections to every exchange, developers can directly store API Keys with Shrimpy and even trade on top of Shrimpy’s unified interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our journey begins at the Shrimpy developer APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.shrimpy.io/"&gt;Shrimpy | Crypto Trading APIs for Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Register for your Developer Account&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Shrimpy Universal Crypto Exchange API requires you to first register with the Shrimpy developer platform &lt;a href="https://developers.shrimpy.io/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s free to sign up and everyone gets 10 free credits, which is enough for 10 months of testing the developer APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Master API Keys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will first have to create a new &lt;strong&gt;API Master Key&lt;/strong&gt; to use the Shrimpy API. You must also have &lt;strong&gt;Multi-Factor Authentication&lt;/strong&gt; enabled in &lt;strong&gt;Settings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the developer dashboard, select &lt;strong&gt;Create API Master Key. &lt;/strong&gt;Verify your account by submitting an API Key request to your email. Complete the email request verification and return to the developer dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;API Keys, y&lt;/strong&gt;ou should now see a new set of private/public &lt;strong&gt;API Keys. &lt;/strong&gt;These keys communicate with Shrimpy to create users, authorize subscriptions, and execute trades. For security reasons, you will have to verify your account through 2FA again to view the &lt;strong&gt;Private API Key&lt;/strong&gt;. Copy and save both the &lt;strong&gt;Public Key &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Private Key.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Keep your public and private key secure! The master keys should never be shared with anyone. If you would like users to be able to trade on their own devices, the master keys can be used to generate user keys. The user keys are intended to be shared with users. We will discuss this in more detail in the next sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PIsNKqTuKIk5d8PWAfokPA.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within your Master API Key Settings, you will be able to add IP Whitelists and enable specific API Key functions, separated into &lt;strong&gt;User, Account, &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Trade. &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s go over these functions in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Settings (Create a User/User API Key)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a User&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you can start trading, we need to create a user who can interact with the exchange. This is easy to do with Shrimpy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Note: These requests are signed with the master API keys.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;POST https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request Body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;customnameforthisuser&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;701e0d16-1e9e-42c9-b6a1-4cada1f395b8&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a User API Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;User API Keys can also be created for each user. Unlike Master API Keys, User API Keys are specifically designed to manage an individual user and can be shared with the associated user. This allows them to manage their own personal account with these keys by directly sending requests to Shrimpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple exchange accounts can be linked to a single user API key. Therefore allowing one user to manage countless exchange accounts with a single user API key. This user API key can execute trades, collecting account information, or accessing full order book data across every connected exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Note: These requests are signed with the master API keys&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;POST https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users/&amp;lt;userId&amp;gt;/keys&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;POST https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users/701e0d16-1e9e-42c9-b6a1-4cada1f395b8/keys&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;publicKey&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;51ac18b7d208f59b3c88acbb1ecefe6ba6be6ea4edc07e7a2450307ddc27ab80&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;privateKey&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;85c977ef4070f1deee70192ba7fd5a6caf534f891e4918cfffec11cd6b625e77db4f80347cb436bcaa8882231bacb02f0798a696f101fdd1ef268d66fc63c213&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Account Settings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to complete setup for trading, we also need to link an exchange account that we’ll be using to trade. Similar to our earlier example, we’ll be using Bittrex as the exchange we want to link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Note: These requests can be signed with the user API keys.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Connect an Exchange Account&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;POST https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users/&amp;lt;userId&amp;gt;/accounts&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;POST &lt;a href="https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users/701e0d16-1e9e-42c9-b6a1-4cada1f395b8/accounts"&gt;https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users/701e0d16-1e9e-42c9-b6a1-4cada1f395b8/accounts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request Body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt; {&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;exchange&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;bittrex&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;publicKey&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;GOelL5FT6TklPxAzICIQK25aqct52T2lHoKvtcwsFla5sbVXmeePqVJaoXmXI6Qd&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;privateKey&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;SelUuFq1sF2zGd97Lmfbb4ghITeziKo9IvM5NltjEdffatRN1N5vfHXIU6dsqRQw&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 1234&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect! Now we have our user all set up. Let’s start trading!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trading&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Account Balances&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to know which assets an account is holding on an exchange, we need to collect balance data. This can be done easily with Shrimpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Note: These requests can be signed with user API keys.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;GET https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users/&amp;lt;userId&amp;gt;/accounts/&amp;lt;exchangeAccountId&amp;gt;/balance&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;GET &lt;a href="https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users/701e0d16-1e9e-42c9-b6a1-4cada1f395b8/accounts/123/balance"&gt;https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users/701e0d16-1e9e-42c9-b6a1-4cada1f395b8/accounts/123/balance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{&lt;br&gt;  &amp;quot;retrievedAt&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2019-01-09T19:17:33.000Z&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;  &amp;quot;balances&amp;quot;: [&lt;br&gt;    {&lt;br&gt;      &amp;quot;symbol&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;KCS&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;      &amp;quot;nativeValue&amp;quot;: 2306,&lt;br&gt;      &amp;quot;btcValue&amp;quot;: 0.33486579,&lt;br&gt;      &amp;quot;usdValue&amp;quot;: 1327.8775274784&lt;br&gt;    },&lt;br&gt;    {&lt;br&gt;      &amp;quot;symbol&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ETH&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;      &amp;quot;nativeValue&amp;quot;: 4.0e-8,&lt;br&gt;      &amp;quot;btcValue&amp;quot;: 1.4960564e-9,&lt;br&gt;      &amp;quot;usdValue&amp;quot;: 5.9324652822859e-6&lt;br&gt;    }&lt;br&gt;  ]&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awesome! It was that simple to get the balances for our exchange account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Execute Trades&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how easy it is to perform a trade with Shrimpy. We will use the following endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;POST https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users/&amp;lt;userId&amp;gt;/accounts/&amp;lt;exchangeAccountId&amp;gt;/trades&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This endpoint provides a simple method to execute a single trade through the Shrimpy APIs. All we will need to do is specify the “from” asset, the “to” asset, and the “amount”. With this information, Shrimpy will intelligently route your trades through quote currencies (if necessary) to accomplish the trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Note: These requests can be signed with the user API keys.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;POST &lt;a href="https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users/701e0d16-1e9e-42c9-b6a1-4cada1f395b8/accounts/123/trades"&gt;https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/users/701e0d16-1e9e-42c9-b6a1-4cada1f395b8/accounts/123/trades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request Body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;fromSymbol&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;BTC&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;toSymbol&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ETH&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;amount&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0.01&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s it! You have now successfully submitted a trade through Shrimpy’s Trading API. Wasn’t that a piece of cake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve gone through the process to execute a trade, let’s explore some other useful endpoints that are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you might be wondering how you can execute a trading strategy based on market data. Shrimpy can collect market data based on the complete order book or the ticker. In this example, we will look at the ticker. For order book data, please refer to our &lt;a href="https://developers.shrimpy.io/docs/#market"&gt;API documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;GET https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/exchanges/&amp;lt;exchange&amp;gt;/ticker&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;GET https://dev-api.shrimpy.io/v1/exchanges/kucoin/ticker&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[&lt;br&gt;  {&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Bitcoin&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;symbol&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;BTC&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;priceUsd&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;3700.0089335&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;priceBtc&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;percentChange24hUsd&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;4.191224354581092&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;lastUpdated&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2018-12-19T22:51:13.000Z&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;  },&lt;br&gt;  {&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Ethereum&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;symbol&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ETH&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;priceUsd&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;100.114205389399&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;priceBtc&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0.027057825&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;percentChange24hUsd&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;5.432113558652999&amp;quot;,&lt;br&gt;    &amp;quot;lastUpdated&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2018-12-19T22:51:13.000Z&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;  },&lt;br&gt;  ...&lt;br&gt;]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Start Building&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These endpoints should be enough to start building many applications. If you have other features you need, check out the &lt;a href="https://developers.shrimpy.io/"&gt;Shrimpy APIs&lt;/a&gt; for additional functionality. We support limit orders, open orders, full order book data, and much more.

Today’s guest is &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardiskra/"&gt;Edward Iskra&lt;/a&gt;, Communications Director and Board Member in &lt;a href="https://bitcoingold.org/"&gt;Bitcoin Gold&lt;/a&gt;, who was very nice to sit down with our marketing manager &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauline-shangett-645139169/"&gt;Pauline&lt;/a&gt; and talk about BTG, its history, features, and future updates!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey there, Edward! Could you tell me a little bit about yourself and your background? Was the Bitcoin Gold your first sort of venture into the crypto world?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, it wasn’t. I’m a little older than an average person in crypto. I got my computer science degree back in the early 90s. I was following the news about Bitcoin during its first peak over $1k value, before the Mt. Gox era. I wasn’t actively involved, though — no mining or investing — I was too busy working as an IT director in a small investment bank in New York. I was pretty interested, though — it fascinated me, I was even strongly considering firing up a Ripple gateway. Less than a year later, during the coin market collapse, I thought, “Hey, I was brilliant not to get involved!”, but that’s just hindsight, you know. Years later I started watching the industry evolve, more and more projects appeared, all of them with philosophies different from Bitcoin — some interesting, some of them less interesting; Ethereum got to be really interesting, because it brought back GPU mining. One of the things that got me when I was first looking into Bitcoin was the fact that, although I could take a bunch of my servers and start mining Bitcoin on them, because we didn’t pay for power — we had a contract with a data center who did — the earnings would be really small, because ASICs were already beginning to take over, and I had no interest in sending several thousand dollars overseas to a company that might not send me anything for months, hoping I could make it back. With the rise of other algorithms — CPU-mined and GPU-mined coins — those piqued my interest. In early 2017, when Ethereum was mined heavily and was beginning to rise, and Bitcoin was beginning to rise I started investing. I started getting into Bitcoin around the 6–7 hundred dollar mark in January 2017, I also started doing some mining, acquiring more GPUs, doing mining rigs, overall becoming a more aggressive GPU miner, as far as home skills go — I never set up a data center and became a large-scale miner. That’s what led my interest to Bitcoin Gold specifically. In the summer of 2017 there was a sort of split in Bitcoin happening between the people who were more interested in big blocks and people who were more interested in SegWit and bringing about new things like Lightning Network; and from there emerged the idea to set up a variant of Bitcoin with a completely different type of mining, and what I found fascinating about that was that the rift between big blockers and SegWit people was largely following the rift between miners, developers, and users. This separation is a part of what is driving the wedge in the community — the miners had a different mindset about certain things than the pool of users, and you could see that rift forming. And at the time Bitcoin Gold came out, the key aim of launching it was to set up a coin with the same history of Bitcoin, but which would be mined on GPUs. And for me, there was double “Aha!” moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One: if the community forms around that, then the same people would be involved in using the coin as in mining the coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two: I like the idea of the decentralization of that. I like the idea that you don’t have to spend thousands of dollars to buy ASICs in order to start mining, instead — just use the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And thirdly, I had just invested in a bunch of GPUs, so I was like, “Great! Another coin I can mine!” And I followed the project — followed the forums, did some software prep to be able to turn things on. During these early stages it came out that the team needed some help. They were looking for native English speakers who would help improving the language and some of the administration behind the scenes. I responded, we started working together, and a couple of months later they promoted me to a communications director, I became a core member of the team, and I’ve been on board of the organisation since January 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And as far as I can gather, Martin Kuvandzhiev was the co-founder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, one of the 6 co-founders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you mind telling me a couple words about the people who are responsible for Bitcoin Gold’s existence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, it was conceived in spring of 2017, and it really came to fruition around the middle of summer of 2017, around the same time as the Bitcoin Cash / Bitcoin rift was happening. Jack Liao, who is also the CEO of Lightningasic, was witnessing among his peers and among those working in the mining industry that rift that was going on, and he felt, as did some others, that a part of the problem was the separation between miners, the users, and developers. He was interested in a GPU-mined version of Bitcoin to bring the mining ability back to those users and developers as a form of decentralization. At that time, 80 or 90% or Bitcoin mining was happening in China in large warehouses of ASICs. That kind of centralization is bad for network safety, but also this kind of mining means that those people from one part of the world get control over mining, the hash rate and a lot of the funds, so Bitcoin Gold was proposed as an alternative — showing that a hard fork of Bitcoin isn’t something that was going to kill Bitcoin. That was a very big issue back then — people were very concerned about any hard fork of Bitcoin — that either the old coin or the new coin has to die. That (Decentralization) was the very genesis of Bitcoin Gold, and, in fact, you can see the concept of it in our GitHub name — it’s still the original code name, which is BTCGPU — kinda says it right there, having Bitcoin mined on a GPU. So, Jack recruited a couple of people to make it happen. They included H4X, who is our lead developer, and Robert, who was also a long time Bitcoiner, who was involved in the social space and knew some influencers. Robert was working hard on connecting with people in social space, looking for the people to join the project. H4X was and is our lead developer, he’s a very talented engineer; he’s a young guy, but he’s been doing really good work, and he has a deep understanding of crypto and the crypto space. H4X and Jack are both based in China, and Robert is based here in the US. And they also recruited Franco, he is a designer based in Colombia who has been involved in the crypto space — he is responsible for all the improvements you saw in the Bitcoin Gold website after the first version, and Martin Kuvandzhiev, who is also a young developer/engineer, who was also doing interesting things, he’s the CEO of a development firm — he’s gone to NASA competitions in the US, has had some really nice prizes. Martin was involved in the first implementation of the code that we did, he was also heavily involved with porting the pool software so that pools could stand up to mine Bitcoin Gold. Since then, he’s stepped away from development and became more involved with the business development side of things. And the 6th original co-founder — Alejandro, based in Spain. He helped crucially on the social engagement front and administration. They were the original members of the board until they added me to the board. In November of 2018, on the 1st year anniversary, Jack left the team to pursue other projects, and it didn’t make any functional impact because he was not involved into day-to-day administration. In the initial months he did a lot on the promotion side of things like initial business connections, press tours, early exchange agreements, but no day-to-day administration. The second thing that happened then [November of 2018] is that H4X stopped being anonymous. He was anonymous because he was based in China, and back then China was banning crypto mining firms and crypto exchanges — things were unclear. He also was a Google engineer, and the question was how his work for us could be seen by his employer. Since then, he left his full-time job at Google in favor of working full-time in crypto. He is still our lead developer and is responsible for overseeing all the development work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve never thought about the reasons people in crypto stayed anonymous before. I talked with a guy from Komodo, and as you may know their founder has always been completely anonymous.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of it depends on personal circumstances — H4 was a Chinese resident and an employee of a major corporation. Sometimes is has to do with security concerns. Komodo’s model is different. They are more centralized, and their lead developer and founder may have some info that would be only safe to have anonymously. We are completely open and have our code on GitHub. We don’t have any special codes that need to be preserved and we do not have a master node, no zk-SNARKs, or anything like that. We don’t hold any customer assets, no special keys that could be used to undermine the integrity of the project — in fact, the only funds we hold are the Bitcoin Gold Endowment, the 100,000 coins that were mined at launch — in fact, you can see what we have on the website. We have nothing to hide, we have nothing to secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It makes a lot of sense. As far as I understood, your entire concept is Bitcoin for everyone, by everyone — your motto basically is “For everyone, for everything” — is it because anyone can download the app and mine Bitcoin Gold with it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but with a small technical note. It requires a lot of video RAM. There are lots of laptops that can’t run it. That may change in the future as needs be. But now there are limits. Anyone who works with video or who is a gamer probably has a card suitable for mining Bitcoin Gold — and if you do want to get involved, you can go out and buy a card, relatively inexpensively at a consumer retail store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are we talking about, say, Nvidia GTX-something-something? Gamer videocards?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first miners that I was building were based on GTX 1060s, and I think I was also running ATI 470s. Also had some GTX 1070s, so, not the cream of the crop, as you can see. It’s not really profitable right now, and a lot depends on how much you are paying for power. Now, if you are mining just to support the chain, it doesn’t require much power — you could also be accumulating coins at a low price for now in order to turn a nice profit for later, considering the ongoing cryptowinter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, about 51% attacks. We know that one of the main features of vanilla Bitcoin is that it’s really hard to 51% attack — I’ve heard that you need the amount of power needed to power the country of Denmark for a day or week to 51% attack Bitcoin. What about Bitcoin Gold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it is good to remember there are two respects in which we say “51% attack”. First, using the cheater hash power that is equivalent to all the “honest” hash power. And as they have more than 51%, they can take over the chain, and they control the chain in perpetuity and collect all the rewards — that’s the most common way to think about it. Obviously, any smaller chain — which means any other — has less security in that respect than Bitcoin has. Anyone using the Nakamoto Consensus which we are, — proof-of-work chain — is going to be more vulnerable to it than Bitcoin. That doesn’t mean we are very vulnerable to it — there are certain economic disincentives at play. If you take over the chain to collect those rewards, the value of the coin will go down, the rewards are worth less, and this still requires huge investment in equipment and power. Plus, you will have other people fighting you the whole time to get control back. And since there are mining pools which have a vested interest in preserving the coins they have already mined, they are likely to bring people together to fight that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more important 51% attack concern to my mind is short-term Secret Mining attack. It is a short time takeover of the chain just to do a block reversion of multiple blocks in a row to achieve a double spend used to make a huge deposit, usually to an exchange, and buy some other coin with it. Double spends are only possible if you can spend less on the takeover than you earn from the theft from the exchange. For that, people usually rent power from a hash power market for a few minutes. They would use this power to mine their Secret blocks, where they mine a bunch of blocks they do not broadcast to the network, they do the big deposit, so they have half a million dollars, and as soon the exchange clears their deposit, because 10 or 20 blocks have passed, they trade it for Bitcoin, withdraw the Bitcoin, and release those blocks they have mined secretly. And releasing those blocks reverses the transaction and suddenly they have the original $500000 worth of BTG back and they already have the Bitcoin, the exchange hs been defrauded. That’s the attack. Our approach to combating that is a software-based one called cross-chain block notarization — a system for our pools and miners to notarize they’ve mined to other chains. And if we see a secret miner has released a bunch of blocks, the nodes won’t switch to that new chain even though it’s longer, unless those blocks also notarized on the other chains. If the secret blocks are notarized, they can be seen, and so it is clear that the attack is happening, and we stop this double spend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, you had to introduce notarization in order to combat double-spending attacks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, and the notarization goes not to our chain or to some sort of elevated BTG master node, but goes to a different blockchain and is not controlled by us. That keeps us decentralized — which is our main goal. The key the strength of this kind of notarization is that the chains that we’re notarizing to are built on different code, mined on different hardware, and are distinct networks from BTG’s. So if any strange activity is going on, all our nodes would still be able to see it even if our own network is split.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any major differences in Bitcoin’s Gold code, aside from the mining algorithm, as compared to the one of Bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously the mining algorithm is a difference, which means we mine different blocks. Every Bitcoin block before October 2017 is also in our blockchain, and the mining changed for launch. We also have unique addresses — Bitcoin’s addresses usually start with 1 and 3, and we have A and G (G for gold, A for Aurum — Latin for gold), so people don’t get confused, there’s no user error. Also, we use fork ID to provide replay protection. Replay attacks go like this: if you use exactly the same algorithms and keys for signing and the same address addresses, once you make a BTG transaction, someone may take it and broadcast to the Bitcoin chain. So you’d your Bitcoin Gold to someone and discover that your coins in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash were taken by that person, who rebroadcast the transaction on the other chains — we are protected against that. We of course have changed the mining algorithm as we mine on GPUs, but we also have change the DAA — the difficulty adjustment algorithm. For Bitcoin we know that every 2 weeks it checks and lowers the difficulty if miners left and adjust the other way around. In Bitcoin Gold we preserved the 10-minute target for a block, but we also have an algorithm that changes the difficulty after every single block. It is done because GPU mining is very fluid. People may leave as the price lowers, it may slow down the chain and vice versa. Also, it is no good if we have new blocks coming not every 10 mins, but every 5 or 2, we don’t expect this inflation — so vice versa as well. Our original difficulty adjustment algorithm was based on DigiShield, and our current is LWMA, which performs better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would really like to talk about BTGPay. Could you please tell me what it actually is and how is it different from BitPay or any other crypto payment systems?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s confusing because suffix “-pay” is used really broadly. IPay, ApplePay, etc. For us, BTGPay is not a product we are producing, it is an ecosystem of 3rd party partners who use Bitcoin Gold as a payment system. We started it at the beginning of crypto winter, which was a terrible time to start this kind of endeavor. Back in those day we often heard “I’m a merchant, I want to accept BTG, but I need to convert it to other coins and need an automated invoicing system”. And we would hear from developers of merchant support services, “we have this great platform, but we don’t know how to reach the merchants.” The other side was the community saying, “I mine BTG, I don’t want to just dump it, where can I go shopping with it?” And we were in the middle, wishing these people could all talk to each other. This is the idea behind BTGPay. As much as possible, we want 3rd parties to build these sites, and we want to list all the organizations who work with BTG. We’re not trying to control things, we want to help the entire ecosystem in a decentralized way. That means partners like ChaneNOW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned that BTGPay is on hold. I was going to ask you about Lightning Network and integrating it to BTG Pay. As I figured it out you are not planning to integrate it anytime soon, correct?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorrect. First of all, I would not say BTGPay is on “hold.” I’d say it’s on “slow.” We’ve been working with the team within an austerity program since summer of 2018 to make sure out endowment lasts long enough until the end of this crypto winter. We’ve done pretty good on that, starting with 100000 BTG-worth endowment and 1,5 years later we still have like 65000 in there. We do have a full functional implementation of LND from Lightning Labs, ported over to work with BTG, we’ve been able to do transactions with it on the testnet, but we haven’t started employing Lightning more broadly because we know it’s not just the matter of getting the code to work, it’s about having processes that can work with Lightning. It’s about easy-to use software that users can use to stand up nodes. We need to build an ecosystem to support the entire process — build the necessary pieces of infrastructure that would underlie all of that. There’s a library called btcd, which is a part of a btcsuite, and we do our version of that, which supports things like Neutrino wallet that would interact well with Lightning Network. You can’t build those things without prerequisites, that’s what we’ve been working on — prerequisites. Prerequisites for Neutrino, for example, include compact blocks, which existed in Bitcoin code in v17, but our initial work is based on v15, and it does not support compact blocks. Since then, we have enabled that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The version the Lightning network that you are going to use in BTG is identical to what exists on top of Bitcoin, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, we are building towards the same spec. Our goal is that anyone who is familiar with coding for Bitcoin or Lightning will also have the familiarity to do the same in Bitcoin Gold, as well as any coin that works with LN. The next step is cross chain atomic swaps, which have already been achieved by other projects on Lightning. We want to do that capability as well, because we want to become sort of a part of a big lightning network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you as a project comfortable with necessary caveats that come with the usage of Lightning network? Everybody knows that Lightning network is in its early stages, it’s more comfortable for a lot of people to use vanilla Bitcoin for now. Are you going to make it more usable for everyone who wishes to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re right, there’s a lot of difficulty in using Lightning right now. There are lots of developers working on making that better. For now, people find it much easier to work with BTC directly — we’d like them to work with BTG directly as well. We are extremely similar technolog, but transaction costs are profoundly smaller. We can be a good experimental platform giving the developers the tools they need and a live blockchain to work with with regards to implementing LN projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about private transactions? You said BTG has nothing to hide, and everything is extremely visible, but I know for a fact that you have private transactions on the roadmap, so what protocol are you going to use to achieve privacy? Is it going to be like Monero, or ZCash?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to be decided before we can commit to a protocol. We are a young project, so we can change our code really easily. It’s both a blessing and a curse. We can make changes to implement new features, but we have to take the needs and wants of our community into account — but that includes merchants, miners, users, and even exchanges. Two major concerns for our partner exchanges: whether or not you are a security — we are not, we have a legal opinion to prove it — and also secrecy. Many major exchanges need to know the initiator of the transaction, and the secrecy of a coin can make it difficult. Banks keep all the transactions private, but we don’t want to have banks, we want to have a decentralized network. It is on our roadmap probably for the next year to start considering and talking to the community about the level and kind of privacy we want to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any examples of exciting partnership cases that you’d like to tell us about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChangeNOW!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think about the situation with this crypto winter — do you think that what is happening now is a sign of change on the market or it’s just regular fluctuations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that it’s a sign of real change in the markets. It’s been the longest crypto winter as we’ve mentioned. And it was a fall-off from a very big bubble. We have never had this many novice retail investors get burned before. When you burn yourself, you are going to be more careful next time. There’s a realization that there’s not great fear that markets are going to drop out entirely, almost nobody in crypto space believes the scaremongers of the news who say, “Hey, Bitcoin might drop to $1000, Bitcoin might drop to 0” — nobody believes that nonsense anymore. There’s a bottom, and it looks like we’ve reached it — nobody wants to be the sucker who sells when someone else is buying cheap. We reached the floor, we seem to be beginning to recover, and people have been doing great work in the meantime. People have done hard work on the underlying code, developing new ideas and techniques. Every project has stuff they’ve been working on. Many people have full-time jobs and they dedicate their personal free time to their project — all that work is still bearing fruit. It’s all coming into live projects now. And that’s very positive. It makes me very optimistic for the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know that BTG has a lot of plans for the future, I’ve seen your roadmap. Maybe you have some thoughts you’d like to share with our listeners and readers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve got the new core client, that’s about ready to go live. I’m running it on my machine and connected with another v17 node in Eastern Europe. I actually got exciting looking at the debug logs — my machine receives a header, I send this header to others, I receive the full block, I share this block as a compact block with the v17 node, then I start receiving the same header from other machines, and all this happens within a span of 1 second. We exchanged the info back and forth between Eastern Europe and Eastern United states, including a full compact block, before other nodes got around to sending me the block header. It’s fabulous what blockchain technology can do, these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things we have: our version 17 core wallet is about ready to roll out. We are going to be working on releasing CCBN as quickly as we can, because we feel that security is critical to support the infrastructure. We also have side projects that we are hoping to put our time into to develop additional tools that will support things like Lightning Network. In fact, the v17 upgrade one of these things that will support Lightning Network. We’ve also got an expanded ambassador program: we had our first meetup in Africa, we had our first meetup in South America — in fact that was in Venezuela, just a few days ago. We’re also going to be doing plasma side chains.

&lt;div&gt;Cyber threat intelligence has gained a lot of recognition over the last five years in the UAE. While some businesses have taken proactive measures by protecting sensitive data and training their employees in cybersecurity protocols, others in the country and the region are failing on their basic cyber protection strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 274 cyber attacks were reported in the first seven months of 2017 in the UAE, targeting both government and private entities, according to data released by the Telecommunications Regulations Authority.  A survey conducted by Mimecast and Vanson-Bourne showed that although 69 percent of UAE respondents agreed on the importance of cyber threat intelligence, about 32 percent of businesses in the UAE are not even using a firewall gateway for basic information security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I know there's a big debate about what the basics of security practice are, but I don't think anybody would argue that having a firewall at your perimeter is something that you should not have. This is a bit of a scary number - that almost a third of people here do not have a firewall set up ... However, if you look back five years ago, cyber threat intelligence was focused on the largest organizations in the world, the large financial services, the large government state actors. If you ask folks today, 75 percent have implemented some level of threat intelligence, and the other 25 percent are interested in doing it over the course of the next year. So it's a monumental shift of folks saying, 'I don't really know what it is', to saying, 'I think I need to do it too' ..." said Marc French, Senior Vice President and Chief Trust Officer of Mimecast, one of the top email and data security companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French, Chief Trust Officer of Mimecast, spoke to AMEinfo in an exclusive interview and shared his thoughts on major cyber risks for businesses, impact of innovations on cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threats facing small businesses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French: So I think the threat is one of resourcing, more than anything else. I think the perception is that you're always going to have somebody coming after you - everybody recognizes that. However, what I've seen - from a threat actor perspective - is that everyone's a target. This was not true before. But now, with the weaponization of 'crimeware as a service', it's so much easier for them to go down the stack with respect to business weaponization. So what happens is, is that you've got all of these smaller businesses, which weren't necessarily a target now becoming targets, while the really big organizations have gotten really hard to get into. Criminals are motivated by money - if they can do a bunch of small ones versus one big one, that will be just as good for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proactive protection strategies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French: I think intelligence is one of the things that's a feeder into a proactive position. Lean on your vendors more than anything else to help you with that. If you think about email, as an example, I would say most people have an email environment, whether they're hosting or are running it. Probably a quarter of them have no way to actually recognize the threats that are in their environment. That's when you rely on someone like Mimecast to come in and say I have an intelligence team; I should be providing you that data to help you in your protective strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortage of cyber-skilled professionals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French:  I think at the top, there's still a shortage of security experts. You see it here in the Middle East; we see it in the States and in Europe as well. There's just not enough folks coming in - and it is part of my job as a senior security leader to bring up that next generation. So I mentor about 40 high-school and college students to actually get them interested in security. And it's beholden to us as security experts to make sure that we do that because the colleges aren't going to do it for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good strategy to have, in my opinion, would be 'force multiplication'. You're never going to train everybody in your organization to be a security expert, but you should train everybody to have a certain amount of security awareness. So if you raise the bar up just a little bit, you'll see the amount of potential breach drop. 100 percent of employees in an organization will tell you that they have done some kind of awareness training, but what we find is that a third or less actually do continuous training. That's another the thing that Mimecast is bringing to the table - continuous awareness training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French:  I think it's going to be absolutely critical to scale. There's no way that you can have human intervention in intelligence generation anymore. I mean, most state-sponsored intelligence agencies use a combination of AI and ML, and that's going to trickle down into the private sector. You need to have that machine learning to actually crunch the numbers. We do millions of emails; I don't have millions of folks in my intelligence team looking at all the data. I need ML and AI and that infrastructure to do some of that base correlation. And then, for higher order, humans get involved to take a look at that and then re-adapt the algorithm to go forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of trepidation about letting the machine do the remediation. There's a conversation going on about people losing jobs to AI and ML and it's not unique to the U.S. It's a conversation in the EU and it's the same conversation here. I would tell you, that it is not really a true statement. There's a security innovation landscape that's looking for really smart people that are going to hire people right out of college, or right out of their apprenticeship program. So what I've seen in our area is that innovation is driving the next generation. There will always be higher order jobs that will need human intervention. Folks will need to learn new skills and move with innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeship is probably the best thing. Because that can come at any stage in life. Most people in the States do their degree in university right after they get out of secondary school, and then ever go back. I'm advocating for apprenticeship programs throughout your lifespan. We do that now with veterans that come out of the military; we do it for older adults that want career changes. If they have the aptitude, and the willingness to learn, I'm going to hire that person, because I can train them to do any one or number of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact of 5G&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc French:  5G does raise concerns about the proliferation of your attack surface. 5G is going to allow for much more connectivity then you've ever seen in the past. It also takes the conversation to how much more connected the human is going to be with respect to that. So now 5G, when it comes to wearables, is an interesting conversation as well. Also, think about augmented reality in a 5G world, you can kind of do it. Think about an augmented reality situation where I need to find my way down to the World Trade Center in Dubai and I can see that virtually on my phone or through my glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now think about that, from a security perspective. So what if I could hijack the stream there and direct you to a place that you shouldn't go. So there's always an angle. The more connections I have, the more technology I'm going to introduce, the more likelihood for someone to actually monetize that from a crimeware perspective. If you look at 5G, it just opens up the opportunity to inject more kit into the environment, which means more real-time connections; which means that I'm going to have more access to data that I need to protect. So this goes back to the ML-AI perspective. Today, if you're going to ask me if humans can do that work - they absolutely can't do that work. So without AI and ML, we are not prepared at all to face the threats that innovations that 5G are bringing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is outstripping cybersecurity. It's just the reality. This has happened in the past with innovation outstripping the security side. Tactically, what I'd probably do is focus on response detection and response in the short term, knowing that the adversaries are probably going to be ahead of me out of the gate. So, my blue team is going to be right on their tail getting up to speed while you make sure you can identify telemetry, do some kind of detection, and you've got a good response by compartmentalization. There are a whole bunch of ways that we can do it. In that time, ML catches back up. And then we'll be in the race that we are today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The new ability arrived on Gmail today, moving us slightly closer to a future where we just use bots to replace our more mundane communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nrBe0"&gt;Smart Compose can already guess at the next part of your sentences based on your writing habits, offering suggestions when you’re about to ask someone “to revisit this next week,” or thanking them at the end of an email. It relies on machine learning to make its recommendations, which Google says “can cut down on the effort it takes for you to write emails and replies.”&lt;/p&gt;

This is why using a grammar checking software might seem like a good idea. This idea is supported by aggressive advertising by leading services in this field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But real life is a bit more complicated, and users often face some unexpected problems. Today we will talk about these issues, and how to determine a grammar checking tool that will deliver better experience and results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robots want to outsmart humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant problems of writing correction tools is that they pretend to be smarter than their users. However, the current level of technological development does not allow that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, take &lt;a href="https://grammarly.com/"&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt;, the leading grammar checking tool on the market. Its algorithm hates passive voice and trying to eliminate it everywhere possible in 100% cases. The system considers passive voice a bad writing construction as opposed to active voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is how this looks in practice. Let’s suppose that you have a sentence: “The car was parked by David.” The grammar checker will highlight an error — sure thing. There is a passive voice! A sophisticated algorithm will come up with a rewritten sentence: “David parked the car.” Sounds good so far, but what if your sentence is “The car was parked by the sidewalk”? Here we mean that the car is physically parked close to some object (a sidewalk in our case). And what an AI-based algorithm worth of $29.95/mo offers here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DIkqipUMANhUxfJW" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when the computer tries to outsmart human. Online helpers should be less aggressive, not try to be too strict about generated recommendations, no matter what they relate to from passive voice to starting sentences from And or But.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a built-in MS Word grammar checker used to be like Grammarly a couple of years ago, but now it works in a softer manner and does not burn out passive voice, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devs overlook privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently Sebastian McKenzie, the Facebook engineer, has raised an interesting topic: the degree of privacy grammar checkers allow. He called Grammarly a keylogger because of its maniacal desire to log any information the user types on the web (excluding restricted fields like passwords forms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, developers listed the right to look into the user’s content in their privacy policy. They may need this for multiple reasons from algorithm training to breaching terms of use of the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;style&gt;body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a summary of why Grammarly are predatory and why you should avoid them. I am not a lawyer™. This is my layman reading, but they are pretty explicit about a lot of these practices. Posting because I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of people oblivious to what they&amp;#39;re signing away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200a;&amp;mdash;&amp;#x200a;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sebmck/status/1104132993893904386"&gt;@sebmck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey &amp;&amp; donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height); resized = true;}if (parent &amp;&amp; parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location &amp;&amp; window.location.hash === "#amp=1" &amp;&amp; window.parent &amp;&amp; window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit &amp;&amp; window.webkit.messageHandlers &amp;&amp; window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;if (parent &amp;&amp; parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  &lt; maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funny enough that a Facebook employee raises privacy concerns, but he mentioned the real facts. You can’t call grammar checker like Grammarly a keylogger as the users grant the permissions and installs browser extension by his own, but the question is why this tool gives no control over privacy to its users?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do some research, you will find other tools with some privacy-related features. For example, Textly.AI allows using its &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textlyai/ndgklmlnheedegipcohgcbjhhgddendc/"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/textly/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; extensions in an incognito mode without registration and features a pastebin mode which works like secret chat in messaging app in its &lt;a href="https://app.textly.ai/"&gt;web app&lt;/a&gt;. This is a much better approach for users. But still, you need to search for such tools by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Software does not help in content creation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another serious problem of many grammar checkers is that these tools check what was already written. But a vast amount of people even do not get that far: ask Google about writer’s block, and you’ll get ~29 million of search results. This is a real problem modern tools do not help to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little is done in this direction now. One of the solutions: Textly.AI has released its content templates &lt;a href="https://textly.ai/templates"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; so that users could build their content on top of it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CSM5kldV_uL5oPVh" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example: &lt;a href="https://www.gingersoftware.com/"&gt;Ginger&lt;/a&gt; allows a sentence rephraser that is capable of creating more sophisticated sentences from the simple ones. Still it can’t fix the core problem of the writer’s block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern grammar checkers and writing enhancement tools can be useful. However, this class of software has its limitations and problems. Thus, to choose a tool that will help you solve your task, there are several questions to answer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do developers work on privacy, is it one of their goals?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the service helps with content creation, or fix what you’ve already written?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is algorithm soft enough to do not force you into using irrelevant recommendations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s it, thanks for reading and post your thoughts on the topic below!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=50835ca654d9" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-is-wrong-with-grammar-checking-tools-three-main-problems-and-how-to-fix-them-50835ca654d9"&gt;What Is Wrong With Grammar Checking Tools: Three Main Problems And How To Fix Them&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2019 19:49:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NBC business: One of Google's top A.I. people just joined Apple -  Puntaje: 250.0</title><link>https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/04/apple-hires-ai-expert-ian-goodfellow-from-google.html</link><description>Ian Goodfellow is a top figure in artificial intelligence, having popularized an approach called general adversarial networks.

Additionally, depending on the sizes of the purchases made by these repeat customers, this will increase average customer lifetime value. All things constant, the higher the average lifetime value the more wiggle room you have to spend on acquiring new customers on existing and/or new channels. You can then use this to coax your investors to give you more money to move into a cooler office space, give your employees catered lunches and buy a bigger pool table to ‘attract new talent’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a starting point you need to get an understanding of the factors within the customer journey that have a higher importance in increasing the likelihood of a customer to make a repeat purchase and then: i.) work to optimise those factors and ii.) maybe start testing out personalised email marketing to customers who are more likely to become repeat customers to ensure that they buy products from your business again- this may of-course include having an understanding of the types of products they are more inclined to be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this context in mind, I decided to analyse a &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce#olist_sellers_dataset.csv"&gt;Kaggle dataset on a Brazilian e-commerce platform- Olist&lt;/a&gt;- with an exploratory data analysis section to explore and understand more about the data itself, user behaviour and potentially valuable trends and a machine learning/analytical section dealing with user a classification algorithm to predict the likelihood of a customer making repeat purchases based on their past behaviour on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploratory Data Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the EDA process I focused on answering questions around: i.) how efficient each marketing channel has been for Olist, looking at the conversion rates for each channel, the average length of time it takes for each channel to convert users from first contact to ‘closing’ the lead, ii.) the median value of customers originating from each channel to get more clarity on how much money should be allocated to acquire customers per channel, iii.) median time delta between the purchase date and the date in which the order is delivered to the customer per state and iv.) the time delta between actual delivery time and estimated delivery time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;merged_list = pd.merge(closed_deals,mark_qualified,on=&amp;#39;mql_id&amp;#39;,how=&amp;#39;outer&amp;#39;).fillna(0)&lt;br&gt;frames = [merged_list,seller_data,order_list]&lt;br&gt;seller_merged = reduce(lambda left, right: pd.merge(left,right,on=&amp;#39;seller_id&amp;#39;,how=&amp;#39;outer&amp;#39;),frames).fillna(0)more product a customer purchases the greater the the customer is customer purchases&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#calculate different between won date and first contact date&lt;br&gt;seller_merged[&amp;#39;time_to_close&amp;#39;] = pd.to_datetime(seller_merged[&amp;#39;won_date&amp;#39;]) - pd.to_datetime(seller_merged[&amp;#39;first_contact_date&amp;#39;])&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#extract days from time to close&lt;br&gt;seller_merged[&amp;#39;days_to_close&amp;#39;] = seller_merged[&amp;#39;time_to_close&amp;#39;].apply(lambda x: x.days)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the dataset is broken up into several tables on Kaggle, the first step I took was merging the tables, opting for a full outer join. Similar to SQL, a full outer join merges all the data from all the datasets. Merging with this and other tables required having an understanding of the data schema laid out on Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aXTlOcs3-l0L4Bi_pyiADA.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Data Schema&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each arrow with pointers pointing both to and from a database indicates the common key connecting the two databases, this is the key that I used to merge each table to build the database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After joining the relevant tables and calculating the difference between the won date (date the lead was closed) and the date of first contact, I created a lambda function to extract the days from this time delta. When it comes to measuring the median time it took to close a marketing lead, using days as a the measure seemed more appropriate given the timelines involved in this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#closing success rate by point of origin&lt;br&gt;seller_merged[&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;] =  np.where(seller_merged[&amp;#39;won_date&amp;#39;]!=0, &amp;quot;True&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;False&amp;quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#percentage of deals closed/not closed by point of origin&lt;br&gt;closed_or_not = seller_merged.groupby([&amp;#39;origin&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;]).agg({&amp;#39;closed&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;size&amp;#39;})&lt;br&gt;ax = closed_or_not.groupby(level=0).apply(lambda x: 100 * x / float(x.sum())).unstack().plot.bar(stacked=True)&lt;br&gt;for p in ax.patches:&lt;br&gt;    width, height = p.get_width(), p.get_height()&lt;br&gt;    x, y = p.get_xy()&lt;br&gt;    horiz_offset = 1&lt;br&gt;    vert_offset = 1&lt;br&gt;    ax.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(horiz_offset, vert_offset))&lt;br&gt;    ax.annotate(&amp;#39;{:.0f} %&amp;#39;.format(height), (p.get_x()+.15*width, p.get_y()+.4*height))&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;To visualise the conversion rate for leads coming through each channel and converting to a paying customer I created a column that returns a boolean of either true or false depending on whether or not the won date contained a 0. This was followed by a lambda function to divide the total of closed and unclosed leads by the total numbers of leads that came through each channel. I returned those numbers as percentages by multiplying each number by a hundred and plotted those numbers on a 100% stacked bar-plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EkicyH26cnRvvA0IhZfAig.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Visualising the efficiency of each marketing channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the visualisation it appears that leads that come in through paid channels are closed at a higher rate than organic channels. This is presumably because there is stronger intent to purchase if a user types in an associated keyword, sees an ad and actually clicks it. We cannot however simply attribute these conversions to paid search for example because it may the case that other marketing channels created awareness and paid search simply drove the last converting click.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*xchtFfvcmyUQ1ifMvKLCoQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A dog jaded from seeing banner ads&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Display seems to be amongst the worst performers but as indicated in the previous paragraph, channels such as display may drive initial awareness which then leads to the customer clicking the paid search ad at a later stage. It may be more appropriate to measure display with other metrics for example brand recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualising the median time it takes to close a lead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#length of time to close deals by origin&lt;br&gt;closing_deals = seller_merged.query(&amp;#39;closed == &amp;quot;True&amp;quot;&amp;#39;)&lt;br&gt;medians =  seller_merged.query(&amp;#39;closed == &amp;quot;True&amp;quot;&amp;#39;).groupby(&amp;#39;origin&amp;#39;)[&amp;#39;days_to_close&amp;#39;].median().values&lt;br&gt;median_labels = [f&amp;#39;{m} days&amp;#39; for m in medians]&lt;br&gt;pos = range(len(medians))&lt;br&gt;ax = sns.violinplot(x=&amp;#39;origin&amp;#39;,y=&amp;#39;days_to_close&amp;#39;,data=closing_deals)&lt;br&gt;for tick,label in zip(pos,ax.get_xticklabels()):&lt;br&gt;  ax.text(pos[tick],medians[tick]+0.5,median_labels[tick],&lt;br&gt;         horizontalalignment=&amp;#39;center&amp;#39;,size=&amp;#39;xx-large&amp;#39;,color=&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;,weight=&amp;#39;semibold&amp;#39;)&lt;br&gt;sns.set(rc={&amp;#39;figure.figsize&amp;#39;:(20,15)})&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Seaborn library offers a violin plot that seems very intuitive in not only helping visualise the median time deltas but the range of time deltas for closing a lead. I assumed that any negative values where incorrectly recorded and filtered these from my visualisation, leaving only values where the time delta was equal to or greater than zero. I assumed that doing this would also filter out leads that did not have a ‘won date’ and therefore had not been closed or converted to a paying client&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fQT5-Vw73b8epY_lNdrhsA.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Time to close each leads&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the visualisation shows that the median time it takes to close a paid search lead is 7 days, one of the lowest of all the other channels, while social and email are a staggering 42 and 35 days. It should be noted that 0 and unknown are both unknown channels and were only included in these visualisations to fully represent all the data presented in the dataset as it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Median customer value by channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next part of the EDA process involved visualising the median lifetime value of customers per channel with the end goal of trying to understand which marketing channel produces higher value customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#average value by origin&lt;br&gt;geolocation = pd.read_csv(r&amp;quot;/Users/emmanuelsibanda/Downloads/olist_geolocation_dataset.csv&amp;quot;)&lt;br&gt;customer_db = pd.read_csv(r&amp;quot;/Users/emmanuelsibanda/Downloads/olist_customers_dataset.csv&amp;quot;)&lt;br&gt;orders_db = pd.read_csv(r&amp;quot;/Users/emmanuelsibanda/Downloads/olist_orders_dataset.csv&amp;quot;)&lt;br&gt;#merge on zip code&lt;br&gt;geolocation = geolocation.rename(columns={&amp;#39;geolocation_zip_code_prefix&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;zip_code&amp;#39;})&lt;br&gt;customer_db = customer_db.rename(columns={&amp;#39;customer_zip_code_prefix&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;zip_code&amp;#39;})&lt;br&gt;seller_merged = seller_merged.rename(columns={&amp;#39;seller_zip_code_prefix&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;zip_code&amp;#39;})&lt;br&gt;#crashing my ram&lt;br&gt;seller_customer = pd.merge(seller_merged,customer_db,on=&amp;#39;zip_code&amp;#39;,how=&amp;#39;outer&amp;#39;).fillna(0)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to carry out this analysis, I needed to merge my existing table with the customer database that contained customer ids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#unique identifiers for duplicate zero values&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;customer_id&amp;#39;] =seller_customer[&amp;#39;customer_id&amp;#39;].mask(seller_customer[&amp;#39;customer_id&amp;#39;] == 0 , seller_customer[&amp;#39;customer_id&amp;#39;].eq(0).cumsum())&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#currency conversions&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;usd_price&amp;#39;] = seller_customer[&amp;#39;price&amp;#39;].apply(lambda x: x*0.26)&lt;br&gt;seller_db = pd.DataFrame(seller_customer.groupby([&amp;#39;origin&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;customer_id&amp;#39;])[&amp;#39;usd_price&amp;#39;].sum()).reset_index()&lt;br&gt;ax_chart = seller_db.groupby(&amp;#39;origin&amp;#39;)[&amp;#39;usd_price&amp;#39;].mean().plot.bar()&lt;br&gt;ax_chart.set_xlabel(&amp;quot;Point of origin&amp;quot;)&lt;br&gt;ax_chart.set_ylabel(&amp;quot;Mean Customer Value&amp;quot;)&lt;br&gt;for x in ax_chart.patches:&lt;br&gt;  ax_chart.text(x.get_x()+.04,x.get_height()+10,\&lt;br&gt;               f&amp;#39;${round(x.get_height(),2)}&amp;#39;,fontsize=11,color=&amp;#39;black&amp;#39;,&lt;br&gt;               rotation=45)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;One problem with the dataset was that a lot of customer_ids where recorded as zero, even though these were presumably different users. Simply using a groupby function without rectifying this error would result in counting all the customer ids of zero as one user, pushing up average customer lifetime values. To rectify this error, I made the assumption that every customer id recorded as zero was a unique user and added unique identifiers to differentiate between each zero — by adding n to each zero, n being the numerical order in which the zero appears, e.g the first zero would be 0+1, second zero would be 0+2 etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ease of understanding I proceeded to convert the transaction price spent on each purchase from Brazilian Real to US dollars. At the time of the analysis, the rate stood at approximately 0.26 with 1 Brazilian real equivalent to about 26 US cents. The was done for ease of reading as the numbers seemed a lot higher than they actually were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/886/1*FBliT3HNYapH-mnTRoSLdw.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;So much money&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then returned the mean total amount spent by customers per channel, or the mean lifetime customer value per channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jmfe7l-rKWlGCyIxjI5reA.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While means are not robust to outliers, returning the median in this context didn’t seem appropriate since a majority of leads did not result in conversions and would therefore have values of zero- giving a median of zero for many of the channels. From looking at the chart presented, paid search appears to be returning a significant mean customer lifetime value- about 401% more than the mean value of customers coming from social channels. It should be noted however, that the unknown variable in this analysis is customer acquisition costs. It may happen that it costs significantly more to acquire customers through paid search. The real value is the delta between mean customer lifetime value and mean customer acquisition costs per channel- the larger the delta the more effective the channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time it takes to complete an order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#time to deliver orders&lt;br&gt;seller_customer = pd.merge(seller_customer,orders_db,on=&amp;#39;customer_id&amp;#39;,how=&amp;#39;outer&amp;#39;).fillna(0)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to look for any bottlenecks in the logistics process (from purchase to delivery) I had to start off by carrying out an outer merge with the orders table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;def reformat_date(df, column):&lt;br&gt;  df[column] = pd.to_datetime(df[column])&lt;br&gt;reformat_date(seller_customer,&amp;#39;order_purchase_timestamp&amp;#39;)&lt;br&gt;reformat_date(seller_customer,&amp;#39;order_approved_at&amp;#39;)&lt;br&gt;reformat_date(seller_customer,&amp;#39;order_delivered_carrier_date&amp;#39;)&lt;br&gt;reformat_date(seller_customer,&amp;#39;order_delivered_customer_date&amp;#39;)&lt;br&gt;reformat_date(seller_customer,&amp;#39;order_estimated_delivery_date&amp;#39;)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#calculating time delta&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;purchase_to_approval&amp;#39;] =(seller_customer[&amp;#39;order_approved_at&amp;#39;]-seller_customer[&amp;#39;order_purchase_timestamp&amp;#39;]).apply(lambda x: x.total_seconds()//3600)&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;time_to_completion&amp;#39;] =(seller_customer[&amp;#39;order_delivered_customer_date&amp;#39;]-seller_customer[&amp;#39;order_purchase_timestamp&amp;#39;]).apply(lambda x: x.total_seconds()//3600)&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;estimated_actual&amp;#39;] =(seller_customer[&amp;#39;order_estimated_delivery_date&amp;#39;]-seller_customer[&amp;#39;order_delivered_customer_date&amp;#39;]).apply(lambda x: x.total_seconds()//3600)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#filter negative values&lt;br&gt;seller_customer2 = seller_customer[((seller_customer.purchase_to_approval &amp;gt; 0) &amp;amp; (seller_customer.time_to_completion &amp;gt; 0))]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since i needed to analyse delivery times, I created a function converting the relevant date columns to a datetime format and proceeded to calculate the time delta for each of the phases in the purchasing to delivery cycle, including calculating the time delta between the estimated time of delivery and the actual time of delivery. I filtered out rows where the time of completion was below zero, making the assumption that these records had been incorrectly recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presumably the delivery times would differ from state to state, in order to capture these differences I opted to group the dataset by state and returned both the median times and time ranges by state. I opted to use the violinplot from the seaborn library to capture the full range of delivery times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*U0fXIdfNiLOs7jrNxVonog.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Delivery times per state&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then followed this up with a visualisation of the time delta between estimated delivery times and actual delivery times- the assumption being constantly underestimating delivery times could possibly have an adverse effect on customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lPqdaxSUNUd-_SJfhVyAlw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Estimated time v actual delivery time&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As evidenced in the boxplots there is generally a substantial time delta between the estimated delivery data and the actual delivery date. This can range from an underestimation of the actual delivery time from 9 to about 23 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting repeat customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this part of the analysis I made the assumption that predicting repeat customers based on observations made from their first purchases would reveal trends that could potentially help identify customers who are more likely to make repeat purchases. This could help me build a model that I could use in the future to predict whether or not a new customer is likely to make a repeat purchase and tailor my marketing efforts to the customer’s profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#column of number of purchases made&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;no_purchases&amp;#39;] = seller_customer.groupby(&amp;#39;customer_id&amp;#39;)[&amp;#39;customer_id&amp;#39;].transform(&amp;#39;count&amp;#39;)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#create column for repeat and non repeat purchases&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;repeat&amp;#39;] = seller_customer[&amp;#39;no_purchases&amp;#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x &amp;gt; 1 else 0)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In preparation for this classification task, I started off by identifying customers who have made repeat purchases using the boolean 1 or True, and 0 for non repeats (False).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categorical to numerical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#categorical to numerical&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;customer_city&amp;#39;] = seller_customer[&amp;#39;customer_city&amp;#39;].astype(&amp;#39;category&amp;#39;)&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;customer_city&amp;#39;] = seller_customer[&amp;#39;customer_city&amp;#39;].cat.codes&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#origin to numerical&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;origin&amp;#39;] = seller_customer[&amp;#39;origin&amp;#39;].astype(&amp;#39;category&amp;#39;)&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;origin&amp;#39;] = seller_customer[&amp;#39;origin&amp;#39;].cat.codes&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#lead behaviour profile&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;lead_type&amp;#39;]=seller_customer[&amp;#39;lead_type&amp;#39;].astype(&amp;#39;category&amp;#39;)&lt;br&gt;seller_customer[&amp;#39;lead_type&amp;#39;]=seller_customer[&amp;#39;lead_type&amp;#39;].cat.codes&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#removing purchase dates with value 0&lt;br&gt;seller_customer_clean = seller_customer[seller_customer[&amp;#39;order_purchase_timestamp&amp;#39;] != 0]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#sort orders by purchase date&lt;br&gt;seller_customer_sorted = seller_customer_clean.sort_values(by=&amp;#39;order_purchase_timestamp&amp;#39;)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#return first purchase made by each customer&lt;br&gt;seller_customer_sorted.drop_duplicates(subset =&amp;quot;customer_id&amp;quot;,keep = &amp;#39;first&amp;#39;, inplace = True)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I will be using logistic regression for this classification task I needed to convert categorical variables I would use as features for my machine learning algorithm to numerical variables. I then removed all orders with a purchase date with the value zero — as no date can beclassified as zero. Since I want to make observations based on the first purchase made by a customer, I sorted the orders by purchase date and used the drop duplicates function to only keep the first order made by each customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correlation Matrix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to understand potential features to use to predict whether or not a customer would make repeat purchases I returned a correlation matrix showing me the correlation between all the numerical variables in my dataset&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-FW7uuvw568m13BZ7wjYmg.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Correlation Matrix&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind returning the correlation matrix for all numerical variables is to get a better idea of the potential features by understanding the associations existing in the dataset. This also plays the additional role of mitigating against multicollinearity by understanding where dependencies lie within the dataset. This is especially useful since I am planning on using a linear model (transformed by the logistic function) for this task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What stands out from the correlation matrix is the strong association between review score, freight value and likelihood to be a repeat customer. These attributes appear to potentially offer the strongest predictive power for my logistic regression model. However because of the seemingly strong dependency between some of the variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the logistic regression model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although regression algorithms are typically best suited for predicting continuous variables, logistic regression returns the probability of a binary event occurring. While we can technically use a linear regression algorithm for the same task, the problem is that with linear regression you fit a straight ‘best fit’ line through your sample. Using this for classification problems based on the probability of an event occurring could potentially give you results where the probability is below 0 or over 1(&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning"&gt;best explained in the Stanford Machine Learning specialisation on Coursera&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/408/1*q_aPCWXG6a5VBu37KwylrQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;1 represents the maximum value of the S-cruve and t denotes the steepness of the curve&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With logistic regression we use the sigmoid function to convert the straight line to an S-shaped curve that does not go below 0 or 1 returning probabilities between these two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HXCBO-Wx5XhuY_OwMl0Phw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Logistic function s-curve&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of my dataset the logistic regression model would return the probability of a customer being a repeat customer, if the probability exceeds 0.5 the customer would be classified as a repeat customer. I chose to use this algorithm because of its ease of interpretability and it seemed very appropriate for the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression&lt;br&gt;from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score &lt;br&gt;from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split&lt;br&gt;#defining features and target&lt;br&gt;X = seller_customer[[&amp;#39;origin&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;review_score&amp;#39;]].values&lt;br&gt;y = seller_customer[&amp;#39;repeat&amp;#39;].values&lt;br&gt;X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)&lt;br&gt;logisticModel = LogisticRegression()&lt;br&gt;#training data with logistic regression model&lt;br&gt;logisticModel.fit(X_train,y_train)&lt;br&gt;#predicting with models&lt;br&gt;predicts = logisticModel.predict(X_test)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#test model accuracy&lt;br&gt;from sklearn.metrics import classification_report&lt;br&gt;#print(classification_report(y_test,predicts))&lt;br&gt;print(&amp;quot;Accuracy:&amp;quot;, accuracy_score(y_test, predicts))&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/492/1*9kOw3FYu0pl8hlzvEGorUQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Classification report and accuracy score&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html"&gt;classification report&lt;/a&gt; in my code displays multiple measures including: precision, f1-score, recall and support for each class. In its entirety the report is used as method to assess the quality of predictions made by a classification algorithm. Precision shows the percentage of correct predictions made by the model (the accuracy of the model/accuracy score) in this context for each of the binary outcomes. Recall returns the score for the ability of the classifier to find all positive instances for each of the outcomes while the f1-score and support return the percent of positive predictions that turned out to be correct and the number of true responses lying within each outcome respectively. Translating this to intuitive results, the model can predict with about 91.05% accuracy whether or not a customer is likely to be a repeat customer based on the assumptions made through my analysis (assumptions defining what a repeat customer is). The model better predicts whether a person will not be a repeat customer- with the precision of such predictions at about 95%. It may be possible to generalise this model to new customers interacting with the brand to possibly predict their likelihood to make repeat purchases, this will generally be largely driven by the customer’s review score and the freight value paid for the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus concludes my berceuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to reach out with any criticism, feedback, advice and tickets to Avengers Endgame on my Twitter @Emmoemm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b430c9719994" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/predicting-the-likelihood-of-a-customer-to-make-repeat-purchases-using-logistic-regression-b430c9719994"&gt;Predicting the likelihood of a customer to make repeat purchases using logistic regression&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2019 19:41:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>the verge: Google dissolves AI ethics board just one week after forming it -  Puntaje: 1200</title><link>https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18296113/google-ai-ethics-board-ends-controversy-kay-coles-james-heritage-foundation</link><description>&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zkwb-2H8OXzZ3eORwTdqbEAyApI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63353569/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="U6l86L"&gt;Google today disclosed that it has dissolved a short-lived, external advisory board designed to monitor its use of artificial intelligence, following a week of controversy regarding the company’s selection of members.

&lt;div&gt;Artificial intelligence and machine learning are about to change the way we learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent Forbes Coaches Council report comprising firsthand insights from top business leaders around the globe show that, as certain roles begin to be phased out we are likely to see new roles emerge. This will require people to continuously learn, adapt, and incorporate new learning into their daily lives if they want to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study conducted by the Boston University School of Law and initially published in the Harvard Business Review comprising of data collected over 16 years from 36,000 firms in the Netherlands and covering about 5 million workers each year, shows that highly-paid workers are more commonly affected than low-paid workers by the introduction or expansion of automation. However, the repercussions of automation are more severe on the lives of those low-paid workers that are affected by automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although automation does not always equate with mass layoffs or over-the-top fears of plant closures, spikes in automation correspond to the loss of earnings and work, the study shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is corroborated by recent research conducted by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which states that 14 percent of jobs performed by humans are vulnerable while another 32 percent of jobs will see workers need significant upskilling or reskilling due to automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upskilling an aging population&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While automation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are on the cusp of changing the globe, the average number of people over the age of 80 has increased sevenfold. A study by the World Health Organization (WHO) on global aging and health shows that for the first time in history, the world will have more humans over the age of 65 than those under the age of five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could the combination of emerging digital and social trends mean for the way older generations learn and work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “long-term” solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifelong learning is not an option anymore; it’s quickly becoming a necessity as workers strive to stay relevant. Whether it is employers investing in upskilling their employees through internal training, educators constantly challenging the boundaries of full-time and distance education, or organizations investing in smart solutions to cut costs and increase efficiency – there are plenty of innovations reshaping the traditional education template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, online learning and an improvement in educational technology is not in itself the answer. There is a need for hybrid long-term solutions, that combine online learning with face-to-face interaction a Barclays “Beyond 100: Whitepaper” indicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that while the global workforce will need to accommodate and adapt to automation and machine learning, there could be new opportunities available for older workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurship, there are now more new entrepreneurs in the U.S. above the age of 45 (51 percent) than those under the age of 45. Also, the proportion of new entrepreneurs age 55 to 64 has increased from 15 percent to 26 percent between 1996 and 2016, while new entrepreneurs between the ages of 20 to 34 have considerably decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The traditional three-stage life – learning in childhood and adolescence, working throughout adulthood and spending our older years in retirement – could be completely redefined by the next generation,” the Barclays whitepaper states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A longer, healthy life could mean that people can switch between learning and working in a more flexible manner. It also means that the global workforce could be shaped by freelancers and flexible workers of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;br&gt;In today’s fast moving data ecosystems, getting the right insights in time can be as hard as filling a cup from a fire hydrant. The only intelligent way to achieve bottom-line results from data is to be equipped with data analytics capabilities. Data analytics tools have been around for decades and they have evolved from simple Excel spreadsheet analysis of the 1990s to advanced predictive analytics solutions post-2010s. Analytics algorithms &amp;amp;amp; tools are still evolving, and the new wave of development &amp;amp;amp; acceptance of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are making the market more promising. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), global spending on big data and business analytics will grow from nearly $122 billion in 2015 to $187 billion in 2019.

&lt;div&gt;Prominent regional publisher Mediaquest, in collaboration with Trends and INSEAD, is hosting the 5th edition of TOP CEO in Bahrain this coming April 11 at Al Areen Palace &amp;amp; Spa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the theme of “Growth in a Volatile Future”, the event aims at finding solutions to the many challenges facing and transforming today’s business environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From disruptive fintech to trade wars and oil sanctions, these are some of the topics speakers will attempt to sift through in search of a clearer path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome address&lt;br /&gt;
1. ALEXANDRE HAWARI- CO-CEO MEDIAQUEST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandre (Alex) Hawari is the Co-Chief Executive Officer of leading publishing and Media Company in the Middle East region, Mediaquest Corp. Holding an Executive MBA from Harvard Business School in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, Alexandre launched Mediaquest in 1997 alongside his brother and Co-CEO, Julien Hawari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex, who grew up in Paris, has various interests that include reading, playing squash and travelling. But it’s his keen eye for business, target setting, fearless attitude, and seriously disarming smile and sense of humour, that sets him apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An accomplished winner, Alex leads by example and has great ability to convince anyone of anything, and create a sizeable network around him to achieve his vision. He has co-built a media dynasty, from fashion to business, technology and advertising to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex invests in creative ideas and passionate people and is willing to take any calculated risk that merges these two elements in ways that make a lasting difference in everyone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As you cannot change the past or completely be sure of your Future, have no fear and enjoy working on the present.” Alex Hawari&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT TOP CEO Alexandre Hawari will deliver the opening speech along with H.E. Khalid Al Rumaihi- CEO of Bahrain Economic Development Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. H.E. KHALID AL RUMAIHI- CEO OF BAHRAIN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.E. Khalid Al Rumaihi was appointed the Chairman of the Bahrain Development Bank in March 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a fluent English speaker who is frequently invited to comment on issues related to Bahrain and the global economy, using an engaging manner and always bringing robust knowledge of business, technology and regulatory environments to the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

Keynote Speakers&lt;br /&gt;
1. PROF. NOURIEL ROUBINI – RENOWNED AMERICAN ECONOMIST AND AUTHOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof of Economics at New York University’s Stern School of Business, Nouriel Roubini is a renowned American economist who predicted the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. In late 2018, he co-authored an article published by Project-Syndicate.org entitled 'The Makings of a 2020 Recession and Financial Crisis' where he says: “Come 2020, the stage will be set for another downturn – and, unlike in 2008, governments will lack the policy tools to manage it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forbes wrote that his research on emerging markets makes him an expert on speculative bubbles of all sorts. He is bearish on Cryptocurrencies. Forbes quoted him as saying: “Bitcoin is not money. To be money it would need to be a unit of account, means of payment, and a stable source of value and purchasing power. Bitcoin is none of these. Other cryptos are worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Roubini has extensive policy experience as well as broad academic credentials. He was Co-Founder and Chairman of Roubini Global Economics from 2005-16 – a firm whose website was named one of the best economics web resources by BusinessWeek, Forbes, the Wall Street Journal and the Economist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are among numerous other prominent public and private institutions that draw upon his advisory expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT TOP CEO, Prof. Roubini is a keynote speaker on “Building Knowledge Economies”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Roubini will lay out the road map for building Knowledge Economies in the GCC with focus on the future of Fintech, cryptocurrencies, digital transformation, and the new global economic realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. JASSIM ALSEDDIQI IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF ADFG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has been at the helm of ADFG since its establishment in 2011, transforming it into one of the leading and fastest growing investment management companies in the MENA region. Alseddiqi is known for his dynamic and innovative approach, having pioneered investment strategies in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alseddiqi is published in media as having grown ADFG assets under management to $20bn in various investment platforms including private equity, real estate and technology. ADFG investment in Shuaa Capital repositioned the Dubai-based financial services provider as a key player in the region’s financial sector in 2017, when it netted just over $20 million in profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alseddiqi is also responsible for increasing the value of Bahrain-based investment bank GFH by over 200% after his ADFG performed a turnaround strategy for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alseddiqi is the Chairman of SHUAA Capital, Gulf Finance House (GFH), Eshraq Properties, Khaleeji Commercial Bank and The Entertainer and serves on the boards of First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) and Abu Dhabi Capital Group, ADNOC Distribution and Dana Gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alseddiqi holds a BSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and an MSc in Electrical Engineering from Cornell University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT TOP CEO, his opening Keynote will be “Digital Transformation In the wake of the Fourth Industrial Revolution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jassim Alseddiqi will talk about Digital Transformation and its relevance to the GCC’s financial sector. He will provide insights on the next steps for the region to become a Fintech Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the sudden surge has left the market questioning the move and the reasons behind it, particularly given the lack of any major news or development. As per our research [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

On this week’s edition of Everipedia Culture Roundup, we recognize people that report the facts. Hassan Bargathi was the founder of the popular culture staple Only Hip-Hop Facts. Christie Smythe is writing a book that is an expansion on the biggest story she ever reported, the arrest of Martin Shkreli. Armin van Bitcoin isn’t a journalist by any means, but he truthfully shares his opinion on cryptocurrency and trading to his tens of thousands of followers on Twitter. Marko Jukic is using the scientific method to improve language-learning techniques in order to increase the success rate of fluency. And Muzmatch is the honest dating app specifically for Muslims. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kizn0bVSUb4WL7da" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A picture of Hassan Bargathi&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/hassan-bargathi-only-hip-hop-facts/"&gt;Hassan Bargathi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have ever been on your Twitter timeline and seen an interesting tidbit about your favorite rapper, it most likely came from Only Hip Hop Facts. The account ran by Hassan Bargathi, educated fans for years and had a far-reaching impact on the hip-hop community. Unfortunately, Bargathi passed away this week, leaving many to mourn his loss. Bargathi was a sign of the extent of how far hip-hop has reached on a global scale, being born in Libya, raised in Jordan, and later going to school in Dubai. Bargathi will be missed and surely has and will inspire others with his passion for the culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bUiMN76iXHuKbZNM" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Christie Smythe on Linkedin&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/christie-smythe/"&gt;Christie Smythe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christie Smythe has been covering business and legal proceedings for a number of years, but her biggest story by far came in 2015. It was at that time that Smythe broke the story of “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli’s arrest which became Bloomberg’s most read story of that year (she was writing for the outlet at the time). Today, Smythe is an associate editor for The Insurance Insider and is writing a book about Martin Shkreli. She has sure come a long way from her days reporting for local papers such as the St. Louis Business Journal and the Cape Cod Times. I hope she finds an “Underwriting Bro” equivalent to expose in the insurance industry!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*bb2b_MGpfszFyPku.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Armin van Bitcoin on Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/armin-van-bitcoin/"&gt;Armin van Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the world of Crypto Twitter, there are a number of characters that populate the timeline feeds of users. Some of them are academics, others are traders, but the most intriguing have always been anonymous. Enter Armin van Bitcoin, a Bitcoin enthusiast (obviously) that takes his name from the world-famous Dutch DJ Armin Van Buuren. With nearly 40k followers to date, the topics of his tweets mostly deal with the trading and speculation of Bitcoin as well as commentary of the crypto space overall. Outside of Bitcoin, he is a married man and a proud father. If there is one thing for sure, it is that Armin’s offspring will understand crypto in such a different manner than us who lived before in a fiat-only world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*JoAQtNtEsxJelvZE" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Marko Jukic on Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/marko-jukic/"&gt;Marko Jukic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not every day that you get to talk to someone that dedicates there life to the study of language and how to improve the teaching of it, but that’s exactly what I did when I interviewed Theoretical Linguist Marko Jukic for IQ TALK. Having a global perspective since a young age, Jukic has immersed himself in cultures and languages from around the world both in his youth and currently in adulthood. The main problem he is trying to solve is why the success in becoming fluent in a second language is so low (outside complete immersion) and what methods are there to solve this. Marko himself has significant proficiency in 6–7 languages and honestly, I would be surprised if he doesn’t learn more. And if you are reading this Marko, let me know when you develop your novel language-learning techniques, I would love to use them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kYGDIDDo8CYPCNLT" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Muzmatch Logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/muzmatch/"&gt;Muzmatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are over 400 million single Muslims in the world and only one app that almost all of their parents would approve of, Muzmatch. Started in 2014, Muzmatch is a highly-targeted dating app that connects and matches members of the Islamic faith with their cultural norms in mind. As founder Shahzad Younas said, “Muslims don’t date, they marry.” Muzmatch has gained significant traction not only with users but with investors as well, having been part of Summer 2017 Y Combinator class. With Islam being the fastest growing religion in the world, Muzmatch will be there to help connect all of those in the faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=db03d0db07c3" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/everipedia-culture-roundup-13-factual-coverage-db03d0db07c3"&gt;Everipedia Culture Roundup #13: Factual Coverage&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2019 19:49:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>CoinDesk: EU Blockchain Group Launches With SWIFT, Ripple Onboard -  Puntaje: 1300</title><link>https://www.coindesk.com/eu-blockchain-group-launches-with-swift-ripple-onboard</link><description>Over 100 firms including SWIFT, IBM and Ripple have joined a blockchain association officially launched by the European Commission on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2019 04:00:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Bank Innovation: Dimon Says JPMorgan Inspired, Worried by China Fintech Progress -  Puntaje: 1600</title><link>https://bankinnovation.net/2019/04/dimon-says-jpmorgan-inspired-worried-by-china-fintech-progress/</link><description>Jamie Dimon recently sent some of his executives to China to scope out the competition in the financial-technology race.

This is because it can automate the operational work that data engineers need to do and has the algorithms, analytics, and data visualization libraries required by data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both rolls, the need to manage, automate and analyze data is made easier by only a few lines of code. So much so that one of the books we have read and seen in many data focused practitioners libraries in the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593275994/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=buy05cb-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1593275994&amp;amp;linkId=2d2a66f770b7a104b1b3e13d6ba6fa26"&gt;Automate The Boring Stuff With Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book covers python basics and some simple automation tips. This is especially good for business analysts who work heavily in Excel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also books by O’Reilly that are also a great overview of the basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/381/1*jldkUOvYr2VWvG_euDnqjQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can start your list of books with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449340377/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=buy05cb-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1449340377&amp;amp;linkId=b8499e9945e424fe86cc360f3d0f62bf"&gt;Python Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;. This book covers very important topics like File/IO, data structures, networking, algorithms, etc. All of these topics are a great base for any tech-driven career. It is broad and will give you a good understanding of what you can do with python while also teaching you about common programming principles like objects, classes, data structures and algorithms. If you prefer this book, then there is no need to buy the automation book. This will cover most of the topics besides excel. If you really want to learn more about python and excel you can always read about &lt;a href="http://openpyxl"&gt;openpyxl&lt;/a&gt;. Honestly, if you are a person who likes reading technical documentation vs. reading books, that is probably the way to go (we tend to be book people).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Free Python Videos&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not into reading books and like free youtube tutorials, then here is one of our favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creator Corey Schafer, a youtuber. Has tons of full tutorials on Python, Django, GitHub, Linux and more. All of these are very practical skills for someone interested in going into the tech field. In addition, his videos are really easy to follow along with. The video below is on objects and classes, which might be a little more advanced. If you are just starting to check out this &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YYXdXT2l-Gg"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZDa-Z5JzLYM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZDa-Z5JzLYM&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZDa-Z5JzLYM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/d78d1f12c7bae96903fd020c1fee60ac/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/d78d1f12c7bae96903fd020c1fee60ac/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, some python tutorials are just funny. Ok, actually this next one is created by the TechLead. For those of you who don’t know, the TechLead and are not programmers, it is hard to tell, but he is hilarious. Most of his videos are just on the edge of a joke with some seriousness. Being able to tell the nuance…requires working in the tech industry. For instance, in this video, he actually is mocking python tutorials sort of. Part of being in the tech industry is learning a whole other side of humor. It tends to be very niche and meme based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F5mJ_Qftw2_0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5mJ_Qftw2_0&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F5mJ_Qftw2_0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/337dd2cc27d0b2bb33f53e28d86b56b9/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/337dd2cc27d0b2bb33f53e28d86b56b9/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pandas Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you are comfortable with python in general, it’s then it becomes much easier to learn more and more libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandas is a data manipulation library that allows you to run transformations and basic analytics on data sets. Our one piece of advice is as a user you need to think about where Pandas provides value vs. SQL. Using Pandas over SQL is not always beneficial. This can be for many reasons. If you are running Pandas in a Jupyter notebook that runs on your computer, then whatever data processing you are doing is happening on the limited ram of your computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most larger companies or at least tech companies will use some form of cloud computing for running your Jupyter Notebook. Still, python isn’t always the best for fast data transformations. We have seen someone develop a date_diff function in python that took 5 minutes to run for 1 million rows whereas if they would have run it in SQL it probably would have taken 1 second. This is an important note because imagine if instead of 1 million rows, it was 1 billion. That is 1000x time increase of run time (ok it’s not that simple when it comes to computing but the point is…much longer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandas still have its place and are very useful for preparing and analyzing your data. Here are some great resources for Pandas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Analysis With Python And Pandas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FIqjy9UqKKuo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIqjy9UqKKuo&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FIqjy9UqKKuo%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/777488d0749f65cdad69accfb725b6e9/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/777488d0749f65cdad69accfb725b6e9/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentdex is a great youtube who really makes python in general simple. He creates python tutorials for several topics besides just Pandas. But we really appreciate his down to earth style. He assumes you are starting at ground zero and builds from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what makes his videos probably some of the most effective video tutorials on Youtube in our opinion. Plus, his style is easy to follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python Data Analysis with Pandas in 10 Minutes | Udemy Instructor, Frank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fw4cZnVUTnYg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dw4cZnVUTnYg&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fw4cZnVUTnYg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/ad76a8ae1d837cb8bfd726d51d733854/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/ad76a8ae1d837cb8bfd726d51d733854/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to share a free Udemy video created by Frank Kane. You will see us reference this instructor several more times. He is one of the most professional course creators. Now, this video is free. However, Frank Kane does produce a lot of high-quality courses that we have paid for and enjoyed. He has courses from beginner to free in python and many other modern tech concepts. He also has created a book for Python And Machine Learning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FikOEn8jY2Is%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DikOEn8jY2Is&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FikOEn8jY2Is%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/009d729480122831ff204d2a5d52f346/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/009d729480122831ff204d2a5d52f346/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there aren’t a lot of long-form videos we enjoy. Often times it can be hard to follow these videos for an hour at a time. There is one that we enjoyed and wanted to share. If you are just getting started and you want a crash course on Pandas to check out the video below. Our one comment with the video below is you make sure to change the video Quality. For us, it starts out terrible until you shift it to 720p.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pandas Python Books&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren’t a lot of free books we like online for Pandas. So, in this case, we will be recommending some books you can pick off on Amazon or O’Reilly with their &lt;a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/register/"&gt;10-day free trial.&lt;/a&gt; This is actually at the very least, a great way to find books you might enjoy buying!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, you can’t go wrong with the classic &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491957662/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=buy05cb-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1491957662&amp;amp;linkId=42a9a64770e07dcad65b36017f058970"&gt;Python For Data Analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/381/1*QyY0ZW_zFWjGHpaPpq_DJw.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;image from Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book will cover all the basics, like data aggregations and time series while at the same time take through basic python exercises that will help you learn how to apply Pandas to actual problems. This is one of the traits we look for in books or courses. We tend to need actual problems that we can apply our skills on. It makes it easier to frame and approach the problems.&lt;br&gt;This book, as it states, really will take you through the “nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching data in Python”. These skills are crucial as a data scientist because most of your time will be focused on cleaning and processing data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the few Pandas books we would recommend. There are many other data science and machine learning books we will also add to this list shortly. But there aren’t that many more books that are purely focused on Pandas that we would recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python has several other libraries that we have skipped over thus far. If you are looking to get involved in machine learning and deep learning they are core libraries that make programming complex models, algorithms and neural networks easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning and Deep Learning Python&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/492/1*mHrDuetdLskvNHYucD9u3g.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandas do a lot of basic analytical functions. It aggregates and runs basic descriptive statistical processes. In order to do apply more advanced models easily. You will need to learn Scikit learn. Now, we say this…sparingly. Simply learning how the library works do not make you a machine learning engineer. It is one of the important libraries to know because it contains most of the model’s data scientists will use in python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, Sentdex has a great set of tutorials that are really down to earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scikit Learn Machine Learning SVM Tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FKTeVOb8gaD4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTeVOb8gaD4&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FKTeVOb8gaD4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/d8b6a0f0ead03ca0c08937fd12bda688/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/d8b6a0f0ead03ca0c08937fd12bda688/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentdex has been around for a while, so for newer content, you can check out Simplilearn. It has some newer videos and they do a great job of going much more in depth. We do wish they would have gotten better audio quality but other than that it is a great set of videos for learning Scikit learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scikit-Learn Tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F0Lt9w-BxKFQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0Lt9w-BxKFQ&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0Lt9w-BxKFQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/b27e41a3222ffeb05df2d4ebb68e3ee7/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/b27e41a3222ffeb05df2d4ebb68e3ee7/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tensorflow And Deep Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another library Python has is Tensorflow. This library allows you to set up neural networks pretty easily. No need to create perceptron classes or any other form of object/class that would be required if you were developing it from scratch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Ten follow is written in such a method that it acts more like a graph when compiled that is then translated into c code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One great, slightly hidden video series is created by _Hvass Laboratories. What is great about this series is that it not only walks you through using Tensorflow. It also references a GitHub you can use to easily follow along. All his code is already written out. This makes it easy for you to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fwuo4JdG3SvU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dwuo4JdG3SvU&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fwuo4JdG3SvU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/f8a5e4cc1506f74f62b65c6a3f58f1f5/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/f8a5e4cc1506f74f62b65c6a3f58f1f5/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, we have to do another shout out to Sentdex just has the easiest to follow Tensorflow introduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FwQ8BIBpya2k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwQ8BIBpya2k&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FwQ8BIBpya2k%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/41ed5453a6647052e066e7e280444410/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/41ed5453a6647052e066e7e280444410/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python Machine Learning Book Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For books, we would recommend &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491989386/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=buy05cb-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1491989386&amp;amp;linkId=24f11e81078746254c7eae13bdbc405d"&gt;Machine Learning with Python Cookbook: Practical Solutions from Preprocessing to Deep Learning.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/384/1*Gs0do-FufZ6PuM7SaMNVMQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;image from Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book will start light with topics like Linear regression and KNN and then go into more deep learning concepts like neural networks. Also, like many other O’Reilly books, it has a lot of great practical examples that are well explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491962291/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=buy05cb-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1491962291&amp;amp;linkId=b7606b82f6151571b0ceefbd4b1f95d6"&gt;Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would prefer learning about Tensorflow, then skip the book above and just use this one instead. It is slightly lighter on the machine learning (but still very thorough) but it also has a second half 100% dedicated to neural networks. It covers topics like convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, drop-out and other very important topics too deep learning with Tensorflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Machine Learning Courses For Python&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a few courses we would love to recommend this topic as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have already referenced Frank but we also think Kirill Eremenko is another great instructor. They not only are great teachers, they clearly have a depth of understanding when it comes to these topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frank Kane has a great course&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on machine learning where he will walk you from linear regression to support vector machines. He will also discuss Ensemble Learning and bias trade-offs and much more. Plus, if you are a visual learner, this will probably benefit you more. There’s also an entire section on machine learning with Apache Spark, which lets you scale up these techniques to “big data” analyzed on a computing cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Kane has a list of other courses, and there isn’t one we haven’t purchased and enjoyed yet. So we hope you can enjoy them as well!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another great course is 12. &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python &amp;amp; R In Data Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.. This course is comprehensive and discusses both Python and R. This isn’t just focused on Scikit learn but machine learning in general. In addition, the creator of this course is the owner of SuperDataScience.com this is a great site with a podcast, lessons and more. So if you don’t want to pay for the course, you can always listen to the podcasts for free!&lt;br&gt;Python, of course, is not the only language for data science. Another popular language is R (also, these aren’t the only 2 languages, there are other languages people like to use…except Matlab..we don’t talk about Matlab).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, python is the everyman’s language. It is easy to write, implement and use. Are there tradeoffs, yes, does it do almost everything you need well enough, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope this list was helpful.

This frees your engineers to focus on building what your customers want from you — the features that differentiate your business from your competitors’. For this philosophy to work, however, the platform needs to not only give you the tools to build those features, but also deliver the performance that will keep engineers satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, services such as AWS Lambda are powerful, but they have a number of well-documented limitations that make them unsuitable for some workloads. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cold starts and high latency make them unsuitable for real-time applications that require consistent and millisecond-level response times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The pay-per-invocation model makes them costly in high throughput scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The event-driven model, coupled with a max execution time or data size restrictions, makes them unsuitable for long-running tasks or heavy data or AI processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They are limited to triggers and event sources that are specific to the cloud provider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="https://nuclio.io/"&gt;Nuclio&lt;/a&gt;, an open source serverless platform that is built on top of Kubernetes and comes in both managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and self-hosted flavors. In this post, we will compare Nuclio with AWS Lambda, see how Nuclio addresses the above limitations and explore the new use cases Nuclio is unlocking, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High throughput data processing pipelines or ETL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serving machine learning models in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real-time applications such as multiplayer games.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-running jobs and services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nuclio vs. AWS Lambda&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Concurrency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest shifts from traditional application development to AWS Lambda is how concurrency is managed. An Express.js web application running in a container/VM can handle multiple requests concurrently. In other words, your application manages its own concurrency. You scale the application by increasing the number of concurrent requests it can handle (scaling up) and then increasing the number of containers (scaling out).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*YDY_DY3mPnmh_HZv.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: Traditional applications scale up the currency within the application, then scale out the number of nodes running the application.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With AWS Lambda, concurrency is managed by the platform, and a concurrent execution would process only one request at a time — much like an actor in the &lt;a href="https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/"&gt;actor model&lt;/a&gt;, which would process one message at a time. The application can scale out by increasing the number of concurrent executions of the function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lambda’s concurrency model has its advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It simplifies application development. Concurrency is a constant source of bugs and performance issues, as developers struggle with writing highly concurrent applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It allows you to price each invocation individually because you don’t have resource contention from handling concurrent requests. This enables the pay-per-use pricing model and is one of the cornerstones of &lt;a href="https://www.serverlessops.io/blog/serverless-devops-cost-revenue-findev"&gt;findev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Lambda also has some disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can’t make use of idle CPU cycles when a function is waiting on IO. Since most functions are IO-heavy, this results in significant inefficiencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It requires more scaling, which means more cold starts. To handle X concurrent requests, you need X concurrent executions, which equates to X cold starts. This makes it nearly impossible to achieve predictable performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclio, on the other hand, can scale up as well as out. A function processor (analogous to a container) can host multiple function workers. Each worker is then able to process one message at a time. This system supports concurrency within the same processor, and then autoscales the number of replicas of the processor based on load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/927/0*qs6uWrN92hTaaHCr.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: The architecture of a Nuclio function.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting difference between Lambda and Nuclio is that Nuclio lets you specify both the minimum and maximum number of replicas. And as an aside, Nuclio also supports GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/854/0*TzrOwPONBh5jcpvv.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 3: Nuclio lets you configure both the minimum and maximum number of replicas.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Lambda, you can configure a reserved concurrency for a function, which (counterintuitively) sets its max concurrent executions. But there is no way to tell the system to always keep a certain number of concurrent executions running at all times. The system always scales to zero when there is no traffic — behavior that is highly undesirable for systems that experience regular spikes in traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, my employer, &lt;a href="https://www.dazn.com/"&gt;DAZN&lt;/a&gt;, is in the sports streaming business. We see huge spikes in traffic all the time, as millions of users flood in seconds before a sporting event starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DdBWS2Pl19fpRbLl.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 4: Sports streaming platforms, such as DAZN, experience huge spikes in traffic just before a sporting event kicks off.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the ability to configure the minimum number of concurrent executions, these spikes result in large numbers of cold starts. Also, in these cases, Lambda has to scale out the number of concurrent executions quickly to meet the surge in demand. Here, we also run into the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/scaling.html"&gt;500/minute limit&lt;/a&gt; on how quickly Lambda is able to scale out. As such, we are currently not able to use Lambda on the critical path of our system, which has to shoulder these spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Nuclio, you can programmatically update the minimum replica count prior to the event so that when the spikes come, you don’t have to worry about hitting scaling limits or enduring the performance hit from cold starts. You can also tell Nuclio to scale to zero immediately via API calls, which saves resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EYNfLhAsyW_NHcAO.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 5: Adjusting the minimum number of replicas enables you to deal with predictable spikes in traffic.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Timeout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another major difference between Lambda and Nuclio is how timeout is handled. With Lambda, an invocation can run for up to 15 minutes. While it’s possible for you to use &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/write-recursive-aws-lambda-functions-the-right-way-4a4b5ae633b6"&gt;recursive functions&lt;/a&gt; or step functions to extend this limit, both approaches have their own problems. As such, Lambda functions are great for event-driven architectures and performing short, ephemeral tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Nuclio, there is no max execution time. The containers can keep on running, which in turn allows you to go beyond the constraints of the event-driven model. You can now turn a function into a long-running service, which unlocks some interesting use cases such as long-running ETL jobs and training machine learning (ML) models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Caching State Between Invocations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Lambda and Nuclio functions accept an event and context during an invocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*oINnPxHO7RoJoVA0.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 6: Both Nuclio and Lambda functions accept an invocation event and context as arguments.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Lambda, the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-context.html"&gt;context object&lt;/a&gt; is ephemeral and does not persist between invocations. If you want to persist data between invocations (e.g. static configurations, database connections), then you need to declare them as global variables outside of the function handler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Nuclio, the execution context itself is persisted between invocations and can be used to cache state. The context object also includes a built-in logger, which supports structured logging with JSON and four log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN and ERROR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can configure the default log level for a function and can even override this default log level per invocation — which is very useful for debugging. You also have the ability to export your logs to external services such as Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/884/0*5V8uYkPWbJq_D0Lq.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 7: With Nuclio, you can select the default log level for every function.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/942/0*Y2o23Fk5udldyyvw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 8: You can also override the default log level for an invocation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are hooks for performing context initialization, which is called before the first invocation on the function. This allows you to perform initialization logic before the container is put into active use and removes the dreaded cold start problem that Lambda suffers from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Data Volumes and Persistent Data Connections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Lambda, functions only run when they are triggered by events. Furthermore, concurrent executions are garbage-collected when they have been idle for a few minutes. This behavior makes life difficult when you are working with relational database management systems (RDBMS) and other systems that require persistent connections. Indeed, a &lt;a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/manage-rds-connections-aws-lambda/"&gt;set of guidelines&lt;/a&gt; has been developed to help you avoid the many pitfalls of using Lambda with RDBMS. Furthermore, Lambda doesn’t allow you to use persistent data in standard file system mounts, which forces you to copy to/from object storage before working on large files such as images, logs, ML models, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Nuclio, however, you can use the &lt;a href="https://nuclio.io/docs/latest/concepts/architecture/#data-bindings"&gt;context object&lt;/a&gt; to maintain persistent connections to databases. Since the context is maintained at the processor level, you get better reuse, as they are shared across invocations. You can also take care of other aspects of data-fetching with data bindings, including batching and caching, which helps improve IO performance of the application. Additionally, you can mount volumes to functions, which is useful for working with ML models or Tensorflow, and you can mount Kubernetes secrets as volumes. Indeed, Nuclio supports all of the &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/"&gt;volume types&lt;/a&gt; that Kubernetes supports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Runtimes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Lambda and Nuclio support popular languages such as Go, Node.js, Python, .Net Core, Java and Ruby. Also, both platforms offer a way for you to customize the execution runtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Lambda, you can create a &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html"&gt;custom runtime&lt;/a&gt; and distribute it through &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html"&gt;AWS Lambda Layers&lt;/a&gt;. This lets you introduce additional language runtimes that are not natively supported by the Lambda platform. Several vendors have published runtimes for PHP, Rust, Erlang and Elixir, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Nuclio, you can run functions on your own Docker image (see Figure 9), which can come from a private image repository. This allows you to tailor the execution environment itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also support additional language runtimes through a Shell function, which allows you to handle invocation events with any executable binary. See &lt;a href="https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio/blob/master/docs/reference/runtimes/shell/writing-a-shell-function.md"&gt;this example&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*OZB28_RrilACGrZ4.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 9: Nuclio lets you run functions on top of your own Docker image, which can come from a private image repository.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Triggers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lambda is supported by a &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invoking-lambda-function.html"&gt;wide range of event sources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclio ships with &lt;a href="https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio/tree/master/pkg/processor/trigger"&gt;13 triggers&lt;/a&gt;, including cron, HTTP, Kafka, Kinesis and RabbitMQ. Since Nuclio is open source, you can also write your own trigger for services that you want to integrate with and leverage other people’s contributions. The HTTP trigger gives you an easy way to integrate Nuclio with other event sources that support HTTP as target, such as SNS. Also, since Nuclio supports the &lt;a href="https://cloudevents.io/"&gt;CNCF CloudEvents&lt;/a&gt; standard, it can arguably support many more event sources that are CloudEvents-compliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclio triggers are all normalized to the same Event object. This removes the need to understand the specific event signature for each event source, which is often confusing when working with Lambda. It also makes it easy to switch a function between different triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Built-In HTTP Trigger&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Lambda, you need to use API Gateway to create an HTTP endpoint for your functions. API Gateway is a feature-rich service, but it’s also complicated and often costs more to run than the Lambda invocations themselves. It also adds another source of latency to your API, which, at the minimum, is around 5ms to 10ms, and it can overhead spike to more than 100ms. This cost and latency overhead make it unsuitable for applications with high throughput or hard real-time requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Nuclio, every function gets a private HTTP interface by default. To expose the endpoint publicly, you need to specify an &lt;a href="https://nuclio.io/docs/latest/reference/triggers/http/"&gt;HTTP trigger&lt;/a&gt; similar to API Gateway. However, unlike API Gateway, this HTTP trigger does not incur extra costs and has minimal latency overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/914/0*A7-ly9L1rR9Zs1S1.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 10: With Nuclio, every function gets a private HTTP interface by default.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unlocking New Use Cases with Nuclio&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see from our comparison, Nuclio differs from Lambda in a number of important areas, such as its concurrency model and that it has no max execution time. This opens the door to a whole range of use cases. Let’s take a moment to look at a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;High-Throughput Data Processing Pipelines or APIs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a high-throughput API, the cost of both API Gateway and Lambda is drastically higher than an equivalent application running in containers. This cost discrepancy has &lt;a href="https://medium.com/coryodaniel/from-erverless-to-elixir-48752db4d7bc"&gt;lead many to rewrite their applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclio’s concurrency model makes more efficient use of available resources, which significantly reduces operational cost when running at scale. Functions have built-in HTTP interfaces so you also don’t need to pay for an expensive API Gateway service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to mount a volume to your function also lets you read and write data to/from a mounted volume at high speed and enables building stateful applications. Again, you can’t do this with Lambda today, as it doesn’t allow you to attach &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/"&gt;Amazon Elastic File System&lt;/a&gt; (Amazon EFS) volumes to functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features make it economically feasible to run high-throughput and high-performance APIs on Nuclio functions. The same can also be said about high-throughput data processing pipelines that have to process multiple terabytes of data per hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;APIs with Predictable Spikes in Traffic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclio gives you the ability to configure a minimum number of replicas. This allows systems that experience predictable spikes in traffic to reserve sufficient resources ahead of time and avoid degrading the user experience when the spikes happen. Examples include food ordering services such as Just Eat or Deliveroo or sports streaming services such as DAZN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Nuclio still lets you scale to zero by setting the minimum number of replicas to zero. It gives you the control to optimize for resource usage or latency, depending on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Real-Time Applications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclio does not suffer from cold starts and is able to deliver consistent and sub-millisecond response times on invocations. This makes it a suitable solution for applications with a hard, real-time requirement such as multiplayer games and real-time bots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Serving Machine Learning Models in Real Time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To serve ML models in real time, you need to have both strong and predictable API latency and the ability to load and work with ML models that often are large in size (GBs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclio lets you attach Kubernetes volumes to your functions, and there are no size limits on these volumes. Combined with the performance characteristics, it’s possible to implement these demanding workloads with Nuclio functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclio also has native &lt;a href="https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio-jupyter"&gt;integration with Jupyter&lt;/a&gt;, and lets you automatically deploy Jupyter notebooks and ML models as Nuclio functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long-Running Jobs and Services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclio does not impose a max execution timeout on function invocations. This allows you to turn your functions into long-running services and perform long-running ETL jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclio’s init_context() hook lets you create long-running services, such as an application that constantly reads off a Twitter feed (e.g. loads the TwythonStreamer with the context, which is polling an external service, versus becoming triggered by an event).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we discussed, Nuclio is one of the few open source solutions that are also business-viable. It has key architectural advantages for higher performance or data-driven applications, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuclio is cloud-agnostic. It can be used in multi-cloud/hybrid-cloud scenarios. You can also run Nuclio on a laptop using plain Docker, which makes debugging easier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuclio’s concurrency model and the ability to mount file volumes lets you build high-performance APIs and high-throughput data processing pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuclio gives you greater control over the concurrency of your application, which makes it viable even for applications with very spiky traffic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuclio’s execution contexts are persisted between invocations, and it doesn’t impose a max execution time on invocations. This allows you to create long-running stateful applications such as ETL jobs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuclio lets you attach Kubernetes volumes to your functions and has no limitations on the size of the volume. This makes it possible for you to work with large ML models that often are GBs in size. Nuclio also has native integration with Jupyter and can automatically deploy your Jupyter notebooks and models as functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuclio provides a good out-of-the-box developer experience. It has a built-in logger with structured logging support, and you can easily export your logs to an external log aggregation service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a serverless platform that is not tied to a specific cloud provider, Nuclio is worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/309/0*ecLeKuSLityeFpaW.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is &lt;strong&gt;Yan Cui&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;div&gt;In the annual TOP CEO ranking, which identifies the Top 100 out of more than 700 listed companies on the GCC stock markets, 22 are listed on the UAE stock exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these 22 UAE-listed companies is among the top 10 in the 10 different categories. Top 10 CEOs will be awarded in 10 categories, bringing the total number of awardees to 100. There are seven from Bahrain, 31 from Saudi Arabia, 24 from Kuwait and 16 from Oman who made to the shortlist of the Top 100 in 2019. The rankings are based on financial performance and good corporate governance in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our region is going through a digital transformation and is embracing the Fourth Industrial Revolution at a rapid pace. Despite global and regional challenges, there are several green shoots when it comes to reforms, innovation, entrepreneurship, women leadership, and digitization. In this context, the Top CEO Conference and Awards will highlight and discuss new business models, collaborative economic eco-systems, disruptive leadership, the impact of new technologies and innovative growth strategies,” said Alexandre Hawari, Co-CEO of Mediaquest – the company behind the Top CEO Conference and Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Growth in a Volatile Future'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organized by the Dubai-headquartered multi-dimensional media firm Mediaquest, the Top CEO Conference and Awards is going to Bahrain for its fifth edition on April 11, 2019, at Al Areen Palace and Spa, where business leaders, and more than 30 expert speakers from across the region and the world, will gather to discuss various topics weaved around the central theme of “Growth in a Volatile Future”, while also recognizing the very best in business leadership. Last year the event was held in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights of the Thought Leadership Conference will be a Keynote Address by world-renowned academic and economist Professor Nouriel Roubini from New York University's Stern School of Business. Prof. Roubini’s views on global recession and crypto-currencies have caught headlines across the world. He will speak on the Pillars of Building Strong Knowledge Economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In order to highlight the importance of concepts such as design thinking and decision-making, the Conference will bring regional context to global challenges,” Alexandre Hawari said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Awards in 2019 have evolved and a significant change is being introduced without altering the brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of just 100 CEOs from all sectors of listed companies, we have introduced 10 categories that are most prevalent across the GCC stock markets,” Alexandre Hawari said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Alexandre Hawari, Co-CEO, Mediaquest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awards Evening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Top CEO Awards, organized by TRENDS magazine and INSEAD, the leading international business school, are designed to honor the region’s top 100 CEOs from publicly-listed companies in a credible and transparent process based on hard facts such as growth, profitability, size and corporate governance. Hawkamah Institute for Corporate Governance supports the event to ensure that corporate governance and disclosure criteria are strictly adhered to as a part of the ranking.  Global auditor KPMG ascertains data consistency and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award winners will be announced on April 11 evening as a fitting conclusion to the Top CEO Conference and Awards. For the fifth edition of the TOP 100 CEOs, the group has decided to introduce 10 categories. After discussing with its stakeholders and without touching the DNA of the TOP CEO ranking, Mediaquest is introducing 10 awards in 10 categories. The categories are based on the key business sectors under which the companies are listed on the GCC stock markets. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-Top 10 Banking Companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-Top 10 Financial Services and Investment Companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-Top 10 Telecom, Tech and Media Companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4-Top 10 Insurance companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-Top 10 Retail, FMCG and Consumer Care Companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6-Top 10 Energy and Utility Companies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The 5th edition of the Top CEO Awards, organised by TRENDS magazine (under publisher Mediaquest) and leading international business school INSEAD, will celebrate the region’s best-performing CEOs from companies that are listed on the stock exchanges of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman. The event will be hosted in Al Areen Palace &amp;amp; SPA in Bahrain on April 11th, 2019 uniting some of the region's most successful and trendsetting CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's theme, "Growth in a Volatile Future," will shed light on the Middle East's dynamic but volatile region. Oil price fluctuations, tech disruptions, as well as armed and political schisms affect businesses posing new challenges, risks, and opportunities. The Top CEO 2019 Thought Leadership Conference aims to find growth solutions amid these numerous challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, and leading up to the Awards ceremony itself, guests will be able to attend multiple panels on all aspects of growth in the region, and the issues affecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_1382055" align="alignnone" width="770"] A panel that took place at the 4th edition of the Top CEO Awards in 2018.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Opening Keynote will address digital transformation in the finance sector, providing insights on the next steps for the region to become a Fintech Hub. It will be presented by Jassim Alseddiqi, CEO of Abu Dhabi Financial Group (ADFG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first panel will bring together 5 notable CEOs and will explore the myriad of ways the GCC can equip itself to face the challenges related to global and regional economic volatility, under the title "Future of Growth Amid Volatility."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a region with a major expat population, there has been never a more important time to talk about diversity and inclusion. In the UAE alone, expats represent 88.52% of the population, according to Global Media Insights. The "Promoting Diversity in the Middle East and North Africa" panel will shed light on the importance of inclusion and diversity in the business world, marked by the launch of The Diversity Council MENA, a diversity &amp;amp; inclusion accelerator, by Nordic consultancy Above &amp;amp; Beyond Group, and in partnership with Mediaquest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women as well play a role in diversity initiatives. When Saudi permitted women to drive in the Kingdom last year, Bloomberg Economics forecast a $90 billion boost to Saudi economic output by 2030 as a result. "The Future of Women Business Leadership" will address this and more, with the participation of Lamah Al-Khayyal, Head of Saudi Aramco Driving Center; Paolo Gallo Author, International Speaker and Executive Coach; Dr. Maliha Hashmi, Executive Director, NEOM; and Elham Yousry Mahfouz, CEO, Commercial Bank of Kuwait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCC governments take center stage with the panels "Bahrain’s Growth Dynamics," "Cost Cutting, Profit Risks and Government Spending" and "Do Structural Reforms Attract Direct Investments?" With economic diversification plans such as Bahrain 2030 and Saudi Vision 2030 in full effect, GCC governments are taking conscious efforts to future-proof their countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_1382070" align="alignnone" width="1000"] Manama, Bahrain[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't talk about the future of business without mentioning technological innovation. The panels "The Blockchain Opportunity" and "The Human Factor and Tech Innovation" will bring together industry experts from Facebook, the Bahrain FinTech Bay, and King Abdulaziz University to discuss these topics. Bahrain is positioning itself to become the GCC's go-to tech hub, through legislation such as allowing 100% foreign ownership of businesses, even outside free zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award ceremony will follow starting at 7:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
