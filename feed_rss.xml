But it is a metric which is very hard to measure. Sentiment analysis has been on the rise for the past few years. With the introduction of new packages, sentiment analysis can be done more quickly and efficiently than ever. In this post, you’ll see why looking at the mood on the social media is not a great idea for sentiment analysis. Also, you will learn how people’s interests in topics change over the course of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/678/1*9kX-mI7CrQxsR_rwntRe6w.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Analysis Using Social Media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predicting market sentiment using social media is tricky. From the analysis, it was found that when there’s an increase in crypto prices, people share positive messages across their social media handles. And when the prices go down, people go all negative and share negative posts on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VADER is a great tool for &lt;a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/simplifying-social-media-sentiment-analysis-using-vader-in-python-f9e6ec6fc52f"&gt;simplifying sentiment analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Using it with NLTK Python package, we did mood analysis on Reddit. The script that used was in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the script will do is it pulls data from Reddit’s API. It then assigns a compound score to each post. Now, this score predicts the mood in the post. The score lies between -1 (very negative) and 1 (very positive). Given below is the distribution of Sentiment score:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/559/0*bXG2FLr9woPOsc4e" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continuous spectrum was classified as follows: positive posts, negative posts, and neutral posts. To make this possible, it was important to decide the scores corresponding to each label. Also, it was necessary to come up with an appropriate classification boundary. Therefore, a classifier was trained using &lt;a href="https://www.statisticssolutions.com/what-is-logistic-regression/"&gt;logistic regression&lt;/a&gt; on a subset of data. Posts were labelled manually. After labelling a few hundred of them, a few things were concluded:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of these posts were neutral or the posts by confused crypto-beginners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sentiments and its underlying meaning are different and it’s tough to separate them when you’re labelling the two as a human.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are shown below. It’s clear that the results by computer labels and manual labels are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/0*SyhJYFgw9cOktHqp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to separate the context and sentiment at time of labelling the headlines. The problem is people bet on either side of cryptocurrencies. A happy event for you can be a sad event for someone else. Consider two statements below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Bitcoin market crash leaves behind a graveyard of startups”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Bitcoin crash is a good news for investors”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now both these statements are about the same topic but the sentiment is opposite. Therefore, it is hard to analyze the sentiment using mood when predicting cryptocurrency price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the other way to estimate cryptocurrency price? The number of crypto-related posts increase in times of intense interest in virtual currencies. Does the increase in volume lead to increase in price? Are both linked in any way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a better idea, it would be nice to check out the volume of posts on certain topics. Posts on different topics will have a different impact on crypto price. Posts about vulnerabilities in crypto would have a negative impact on price. On the other hands, posts like bitcoin’s high security would have an increase in price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posts that we see on social media platforms like &lt;a href="http://reddit.com"&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mamby.com"&gt;mamby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/login"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; etc. are very short and they do not provide a good set for sentiment analysis. There’s a &lt;a href="https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/"&gt;News API&lt;/a&gt; that combines articles from all the main news outlets about crypto. These articles have body text and the headlines as well which can be used for better analysis. It also saves the hassle of doing a lot of content scraping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the question is how to classify these articles into different topics? Well, this can be with the help of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@lettier/how-does-lda-work-ill-explain-using-emoji-108abf40fa7d"&gt;Latent Dirichlet Allocation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic concept behind LDA is learning topics from different words found in the text, and then figuring out which topic the document is about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the stages of LDA:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a distribution for every topic which tells your understand of word it contains. Also, create a distribution for every document that defines your understanding of topics it contain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allocate topics to each document by drawing each of them randomly from initial distribution. Do the same for the words as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do an optimization and arrange most natural grouping of words to those topics and topics to documents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;LDA is not supervised. One cannot know which particular words a topic will contain or which topics a document will have. To make it easier, it’s better to specify “uniform distribution” as a prior. Also, it’s hard to predict the number of topics in a document. So, the number was just a guesstimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LDA system was implemented on approximately 48,000 news articles with 27 topics. Below are some of the topics which were discovered:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/626/0*JhL8q3Li06cICPfl" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be concluded that topic 4 is about ICOs. However, it’s not possible to predict all the topics using this. The goal was to predict the price using these topics. But the topics could not be explained easily. Thus, it was bit hard to make price prediction using LDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of news about crypto that breaks everyday. And there are some main topics. To make a correct estimation about the price, it is better to decide on some topics rather than choosing a random number of these topics. When there are some common topics, it would be easier to tell the algorithm what words should fall in which category. So, there is no need to use a uniform prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/677/0*yZFVPyGkypkr0tFu" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/614/0*CB6AOfB8HE1l7Zon" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Example topics from pre-defined topic LDA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can specify some words which are likely to appear in particular topics. For example, we can specify that bitcoin is likely to contain words like BTC, Satoshi etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s some initial visualisations using these topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/877/0*vdRTC518hij-a5Ny" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Topic allocations over time as a percentage of all articles published.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/867/0*9RVWiLoB8lhuYnQa" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bitcoin vs Ethereum news articles over the last year&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/902/0*O0XLMIHX1y2CKr5J" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is perhaps some correlation with price. After doing some mood analysis on social media, and some unsupervised topic classification. Using LDA, it was possible to make a fair prediction about the prices. It was concluded from the study that mood analysis through social media is not as effective as LDA method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e18d79899a20" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-game-changing-factors-sentiment-analysis-for-cryptocurrencies-e18d79899a20"&gt;The Game Changing Factors — Sentiment Analysis For Cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2019 10:56:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hackernoon: What is IEO Initial Exchange Offering? Is this the new phenomenon in Crypto Capital? -  Puntaje: 9700</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/what-is-ieo-initial-exchange-offering-is-this-the-new-phenomenon-in-crypto-capital-64fdd60a6e7a?source=rss----3a8144eabfe3---4</link><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*N3y521EDK7rdVwOaCFdtCg.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Initial Exchange Offering&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;2017 &amp;amp; 2018 being the year of ICO, has come up with huge benefits in the crypto industry. But the truth is people have started pacing towards a new strategy named as Initial Exchange Offering. Crypto Enthusiasts across the globe suggest this neoteric alternative for ICO since it is feature-packed with boosted-benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ICO model allows the project to bootstrap themselves without the need of going through traditional venture capital without funding. While on the other hand, IEO&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;enable crypto projects to fundraise directly on digital exchanges!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most hyped news of recent times is one of the AI projects has raised around $5.5 million in just 22 seconds on Binance with IEO!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next five minutes will make you clear of all your queries regarding this platform!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is IEO Initial Exchange Offering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Initial Exchange Offering&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is a token sale hold on an exchange. IEO&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;works on different cryptocurrency exchanges depending on how it gets planned. The exchanges create a platform where the pool of developers can mint and sell the projects to crypto enthusiasts and investors!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the token sale gets conducted on the IEO exchange platform, both the exchange team and the project team will deal with an agreement. The exchange platform will do a thorough review of the project using certain conditions to make sure the project is worthy authentic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the exchange platform is comfortable with the project, it will unveil the date for token sale along with the fixed price per token. If in case the exchange has its own token, then the contributors have to purchase the units of tokens before they can participate in Initial Exchange Offering&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IEO Vs ICO! What would be the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;difference between IEO and ICO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are planning launch IEO as your platform you will definitely have this question circulating in your mind!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the primary difference between both!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The major difference between them is IEO’s are immediately tradable when compared to ICO. If you ask an ICO Crypto Trader they would convey this as to be the worst part in Initial Coin Offering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet another difference is that ICO’s can attract the investments while the IEO can make the stock markets actively participate in the fund-raising process which makes it the most promising field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initial Exchange Offering introduces an intermediary to the decentralized fundraising model, which gives the crypto traders a strong sense of confidence while participating. While ICO has turned out to be the area of scams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another difference is that ICO’s mint their tokens once the funding gets completed. In the case of IEO’s, projects generate tokens and send them to the exchange platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, How to launch IEO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can invest in IEO’s by just having an account on a participation exchange. However, you need to pass their Know Your Customers&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;screening and should not be from the restricted country. Once you complete all these, you can initiate investing in IEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, IEO’s are more user-friendly than ICO’s. All you do to partake in IEO’s is just to create an account on the exchange which supports the token sales, funds your wallet and purchases the token when it goes live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Initial Exchange Offering is preferred?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge advantages for Crypto Investors has been the major reason why IEO’s are preferred and an alternative for ICO. Apart from being able to trust the crypto exchange to be as safe intermediary is the simultaneous listing of coins since the exchange acts a kind of partner organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t sure of which people to invest, anyone can invest rather than it is restricted in the country. As discussed, once you complete all the formalities which are stated above, you will be given access to the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, countries such as the United States, China, Venezuela, New Zealand, North Korea, and many other countries are barred from participating. One more thing is, the rules and regulations may change from one exchange to another but the basic steps for the users will remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages/ Benefits of IEO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By hiring the right IEO developers&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;you can avail the appreciable benefits from their end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right off the bat, IEO&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;will allow the developers to take the complete advantage of the existing user base of a crypto exchange. By making use of the power of exchanges, IEO’s make it easier for more number of people to participate in the crowdfunding process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This new strategy can eliminate scams in the fundraising process which has been the major issue in ICO process. By making contributions through cryptocurrency exchanges, investors will get to lower the chances of losing their funds to scammers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By hosting IEO’s on the respective exchange platforms, crypto exchanges are directly affirming the credibility and reliability of the project. Exchanges need to carry out research on an IEO&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;project before they host it on their exchange platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Listing the project tokens on exchanges would be more comfortable after hosting on IEO&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;making the process less tiresome for all the parties involved here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Close&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change is the path to a better market. IEO benefits are too good to be ignored by increasing the level of trust among cryptocurrency projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing an IEO is not going to be a tedious process. But the truth is only few &lt;a href="https://www.zabtechnologies.net/blockchain-developers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blockchain Development Companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have ventured into IEO development. The reason behind this is there is a limited knowledge spread on this to the crypto people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is still in the growing phase and can be a reap of profit for the traders in the future!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you ask me whether IEO is the alternative for ICO? Absolutely yes! IEO will be the future in the crypto industry which cannot be denied!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please share your thoughts in comment section!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=64fdd60a6e7a" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-is-ieo-initial-exchange-offering-is-this-the-new-phenomenon-in-crypto-capital-64fdd60a6e7a"&gt;What is IEO Initial Exchange Offering?

&lt;div&gt;by Eva Andren, Head of Managed Services, Ericsson Middle East and Africa&lt;br /&gt;
We are in the middle of the fourth industrial revolution. As new technologies like 5G, IoT and cloud gain traction, networks are becoming more complex. It is becoming challenging for humans to keep up with this complexity and keep networks operating at the level prescribed by the evolving services. The potential to change how networks are operated is as dramatic as the machines of the industrial revolution that changed the factory floor.&lt;br /&gt;
Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation and the power of data, the Ericsson Operations Engine is rewriting the rules of network operations. The solution is an end-to-end managed services operating model that reimagines network and IT operations, network design and optimization, and applications development and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;
Managed services play a significant role in the service providers’ transformation initiatives taking place worldwide. Nearly 65 percent of service providers indicate that managed services are key in addressing their main operational concerns around customer experience – improving customer experience being the number one factor that will influence service providers’ use of managed services – revenue growth and cost efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;
It is also clear that advanced technologies like AI, automation, and analytics represent the underlying pillars for supporting and enabling operational transformation. With the ability to rapidly solve complex challenges, AI is essential to network design, operations, and optimization.&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, automation uses technology to remove monotonous, repetitive tasks from traditional ways of working and boosting productivity. With more than 6000 automation rules, the Ericsson Operations Engine drives efficiency at every level of the organization – evolving operations from being network-centric to user experience-centric and fundamentally changing our way of operating networks from reactive to proactive, leveraging data, automation and AI.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
From granular network measurements to aggregated customer experience indicators, data drives everything we do. Growth in data traffic and increased device complexity have challenged service providers on all fronts—demanding new levels of customer experience, efficiency, and innovation. Using AI and automation, the Ericsson Operations Engine processes large, complex data sets to uncover valuable insights and drive new levels of network performance, flexibility, and scalability.&lt;br /&gt;
Designed to help operators manage the networks of the future, the Ericsson Operations Engine has three building blocks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 	Service-centric business model based on business outcomes: Using AI, automation and data insights, the Ericsson Operations Engine addresses targeted business outcomes for service providers such as enhanced customer experience, revenue growth and efficiency. With deep insights into performance and reliability, service providers are able to pivot and adapt networks to meet the growing demands of customers and enterprises.&lt;br /&gt;
 	End-to-end capabilities: Delivering on business outcomes through AI-based design, planning and optimization, data-driven operations, dynamic deployment, applications development, and collaborative innovation. To power everything from dynamic deployment to collaborative innovation, many processes use closed feedback loops to learn and optimize over time, improving operations on-the-fly.&lt;br /&gt;
 	Components: Best-in-class tools and processes that leverage data, AI and automation as well as expertise and investments in the service provider domain. Powered by next-generation tools and expertise, it enables service providers to rapidly test, deploy, and scale new products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Networks are quickly becoming significantly more complex to operate as we introduce IoT and 5G at scale, and virtualize core networks while aiming to enhance the user experience at the same time. Engineered to meet the demands of increased network complexity, the Ericsson Operations Engine combines advanced components and capabilities into one powerful solution. It enables service providers to proactively manage the network and addresses service providers’ managed services complexity challenges as the industry moves to the reality of 5G and IoT.&lt;br /&gt;
The Engine not only enables service providers to impact existing operations but also provides a platform to innovate and nurture new businesses. The OpenWorks lab combines people expertise with best-in-class tools like AI and analytics to rapidly test, deploy, and scale new products and services.&lt;br /&gt;
Driven by business outcomes and with the destination in mind, this is your ultimate Engine to transform best-in-class components into real-world capabilities to deliver powerful results with speed, efficiency, and agility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There are an estimated 4 billion personal computers in the world and 90% of them have free capacities at any given moment. This is to say nothing of the idle capacities of other personal devices, like smartphones and tablets. In effect, this excess computing power is wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of startups are trying to use blockchain technology to take advantage of this inefficiency to meet different economic needs. The blockchain is exciting in this context because it provides an infrastructure for distributed computing power, while at the same time providing an incentive for individuals to link their idle devices to the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the startups I’ve come across are focused on providing web hosting and/or data storage solutions via blockchain. However, the use case I think is the most exciting involves artificial intelligence or “AI”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Democratizing AI&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of applying the blockchain to artificial intelligence is attracting a lot of attention. Similar to the goal of distributed data storage and web hosting, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/technology/how-the-blockchain-could-break-big-techs-hold-on-ai.html"&gt;some experts argue&lt;/a&gt; the blockchain could encourage a broader distribution of the data and algorithms that will determine the future development of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many artificial intelligence experts are concerned that IBM, Facebook, Google and a few other big companies &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/technology/artificial-intelligence-experts-salaries.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;region=Footer"&gt;are monopolizing all the talent in the field&lt;/a&gt;. These giant corporations also control the massive silos of digital data necessary to create and refine the best machine learning programs. Many argue there is a need to &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/07/24/what-is-data-democratization-a-super-simple-explanation-and-the-key-pros-and-cons/"&gt;democratize data&lt;/a&gt; if A.I. is to develop in a direction to benefit all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is where blockchain technology comes in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the most basic level, just as the blockchain allows money to be transacted between private parties without a bank or central authority in the middle. Artificial intelligence experts are hoping blockchain technology can allow artificial intelligence networks to access large stores of data and computing power without a large company or other centralized entity in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Browser-Enabled AI Calculations&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several start-ups are setting up blockchain-based marketplaces, where people can buy and sell data. The goal, &lt;a href="http://trent.st/"&gt;says one expert&lt;/a&gt;, is to “decentralize access to data before it’s too late.” I’ve encountered multiple projects looking to accelerate artificial intelligence development in this way. Serious entrepreneurs with impressive academic credentials are behind several of them (e.g. &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/will-autonomous-devices-become-our-benevolent-overlord-14963b901c83"&gt;Skynet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-artificial-general-intelligence-benefit-humanity-230e213cae12"&gt;Kaasy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, I want to focus on &lt;a href="https://hadron.cloud"&gt;Hadron&lt;/a&gt;. Hadron is creating a marketplace to harness otherwise unused and wasted computing power to solve real-life problems with artificial intelligence. Specifically, Hadron processes and categorizes images and sounds in ways that can be tailored to various uses, such as face detection and image classification. Users who link their devices to the Hadron network perform a piece of this work and in return, they get rewarded in Hadron tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Demand for AI Computation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadron gets its supply of artificial intelligence. tasks from the marketplace it creates, which enables people looking to processes and categorizes images to put in a bid for the task. Hadron assigns the tasks to devices linked to its network and pays out a percentage of the bid proportional to demand. The demand refers to the number of artificial intelligence tasks in the marketplace and supply refers to the number of linked devices. Together these determine the price of computations on Hadron’s platform. For example, if the demand for computation is high, the bid prices will be higher. If the demand is low, the bid prices will be lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Centralized vs Distributed AI Computing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to centralized artificial intelligence computing, Hadron’s distributed computing model has several advantages. The most notable is that scaling the computational resources based on demand is easy. When the demand for computation increases, the price increases, which provides an incentive for existing and new users to link their devices to Hadron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadron recently announced it will be the first dService launched by Aikon, which is a blockchain-enabled API marketplace. This will let anyone use Hadron’s new “&lt;a href="https://medium.com/aikon/image-recognition-ai-is-first-dservice-to-go-live-make-a-gui-bounty-more-bf36a09e2236"&gt;Computer Vision API&lt;/a&gt;” to recognize and categorize any image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While still very much in its early days, blockchain technology seems to hold much promise for accelerating artificial intelligence development. More than merely accelerating this development, however, blockchain also provides a decentralized infrastructure that can side-step corporate and government controlled data siloing while also ensuring that the value created through artificial intelligence can be shared in a democratic way&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe to my channels &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@minadown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/minad21"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; if you like my articles and want to learn more about blockchain and cryptocurrency projects.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;If you have any questions about this article, please comment in the section below.

&lt;div&gt;What's the next big disruption that could change the way we use technology? The telecom industry is buzzing with talk of superfast 5G networks permitting for downloads of up to 10 Gigabytes per second, which could enhance the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, machine learning and bring to our daily lives the use of augmented reality, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etisalat, which was ranked the No. 1 most valuable telecoms brand in the UAE in 2018, is leading the way in bringing 5G to life. As part of its new direction "Together Matters", the company aims to use the power of technology to connect people and enrich their lives. The company, which completed its first 5G launch on C-band in MENA, has stated that it intends to invest 4 billion AED into digital transformation, mobile and fiber networks during this year. Apart from high connection speeds, the implementation of 5G will also lower latency issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Etisalat envisions 5G as a stepping-stone to unlimited potential, a technology that will enable new use cases, widen possibilities, and enhance value creation. Hence, we were the first to launch the first commercial 5G network in the UAE and the region achieving another technological milestone for the company. The fifth generation of the network will fuel digital transformation, IoT, smart cities and the fourth industrial revolution," said Eissa Mohamed Al-Suwaidi, Chairman, Etisalat Group, at the company's Annual General Meeting (AGM) held at the company’s headquarters in Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race toward 5G implementation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etisalat is working on enhancing its infrastructure with 5G towers and sites, in order to ensure that it provides 5G connectivity to fixed and mobile devices, as well as coverage across the country. Etisalat has already announced partnerships with Huawei and Ericsson to deploy 5G across the UAE. The company's prime competitor in the country, du has partnered with Virgin Mobile to build 5G infrastructure and deploy it in the UAE. Elsewhere in the GCC, Saudi Telecom has announced a deal with Nokia to bring 5G to Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, du announced that it successfully conducted its first live 5G data call, while deploying 700 5G sites across the UAE. With the Expo 2020 around the corner, Etisalat is also aiming to provide innovative telecom solutions to the millions of participants and visitors, including an Etisalat 'smart site' at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Etisalat is keen on staying ahead when it comes to next-generation technologies, our investment in the future has enabled us to achieve the first 5G commercial launch in MENA with EXPO 2020 as the first business customer. This achievement will redefine connectivity and support the full-fledged adoption of the Internet of things. As an industry leader, we have a role in driving change and expanding the telecommunication ecosystem, we are building a platform for the future, which will materialize the next generation of immersive experiences and power the digital economy," said Saleh Abdullah Al Abdooli, GCEO, Etisalat Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving financial success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etisalat's efforts to lead in the digital space and transform its operating model has helped the Group's financials soar as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 2018, we have delivered a solid financial performance, with consolidated revenues at AED 52.4 billion, and consolidated net profit at AED 8.6 billion, representing 2.4 percent year-on-year growth. This is an outstanding outcome considering the stagnant global economy and some operating companies’ specific challenges pertaining to currency devaluation, geopolitical instability, and elevated competitive and regulatory pressures," said Saleh Abdullah Al Abdooli, GCEO, Etisalat Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Etisalat Group continued to achieve strong financial performance and maintained its high credit rating reflecting its efforts to provide value to shareholders, which was the drive behind proposing a final dividend of AED 0.4 per share, bringing the total dividends for the year to AED 0.80, in line with our policy in previous years. This represents a dividend yield of 4.7 percent and dividends payout ratio of around 81 percent," said Eissa Mohamed Al-Suwaidi, Chairman, Etisalat Group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
