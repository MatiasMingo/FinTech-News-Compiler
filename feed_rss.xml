&lt;div&gt;Coursera, the world’s leading online learning platform, has announced they are partnering with INSEAD, one of the world’s top business schools, to launch ‘Blockchain Revolution for the Enterprise,’ a new Specialization taught by Don Tapscott, adjunct professor at INSEAD and co-founder of the Blockchain Research Institute (BRI). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With content derived from the BRI’s multi-million-dollar research program, the four-course Specialization, available in the Middle East and around the globe, is designed to introduce business professionals to the world of blockchain, focusing on how to strategically leverage the technology to create scalable business opportunities. Tapscott is one of the world’s leading authorities on blockchain and the role technology plays in business and society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blockchain is reshaping the business world and creating new opportunities across a variety of industries. It is helping revolutionize business processes, drive efficiencies, and even lower costs, so it’s critical that both technical developers and business professionals understand blockchain and its applications,” said Dil Sidhu, Chief Content Officer at Coursera. “We’re thrilled to collaborate with a top institution like INSEAD and leading blockchain authority Don Tapscott to help professionals make informed, strategic decisions about how to use blockchain to transform their business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With blockchain spending in the Middle East and Africa poised to reach $307 million in 2021, acquiring blockchain skills will be key to helping the UAE emerge as a knowledge-powered economy," said Leah Belsky, Vice President of Enterprise at Coursera. "In line with Dubai's 'Blockchain Strategy', which aims to promote efficiency around government services and fuel economic development, our new ‘Blockchain Revolution for the Enterprise’ Specialization will help business leaders in the region gain the critical skills needed to innovate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Educating leaders is one of the keys to accelerating the widespread adoption of blockchain,” said Don Tapscott. “Working with INSEAD and Coursera, we’ve been able to develop the world’s definitive online course for blockchain in business. This will be invaluable to learners around the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no programming background necessary, Blockchain Revolution for the Enterprise enables mid-career and senior business professionals to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Understand a high-level view of blockchain and how they can position themselves within this ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Critically evaluate various claims, applications, use-cases, and implementation challenges of blockchain technology using seven design principles  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Produce a Blockchain Opportunity Analysis to assess the feasibility of a blockchain application within their own industry or organization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blockchain, a technology predicted to disrupt many industries, is being viewed both as a threat and an opportunity,” said Peter Zemsky, Deputy Dean and Dean of Innovation at INSEAD. “It is important for INSEAD to lead the way to offer a universally accessible learning program to help demystify this technology and to prepare future leaders for this transformation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courses in the Blockchain Revolution for the Enterprise Specialization are now available online and kick off with the ‘Introduction to blockchain technologies’ course. Upon completion of the four-course program, learners will receive a certificate that they can share with potential employers and their professional network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As blockchain presents another wave of global technological disruption, Coursera offers flexible, affordable ways for learners to keep up. Coursera will continue to provide an accessible pathway that empowers learners with skills that can transform their careers and their businesses. In the future, Coursera and INSEAD plan to launch a number of vertical-focused Specializations that adapt blockchain content for specific application in industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is not to say applications. I think the applications on the blockchain are crushing it and there are some truly amazing products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Platforms themselves…other than Ethereum have not excited me. In my mind they either sacrifice decentralization for scalability or copy Ethereum’s road map and call themselves a 3rd generation blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One current way to scale blockchains is horizontally. This means to create more blockchains that can burden the load. For this to truly work seamlessly users must be able to walk in between those blockchains as easily as they switch websites on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also can see further issues with horizontal scaling. It is the difficulty, not to create a blockchain, that is actually really easy with the tools we have today. However, to truly decentralize, bridge and secure a chain is a vastly more complex situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to balance incentives and convince both users and network maintainers to hop on board whatever you are building. Once that is complete then you can actually build whatever application you had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polkadot offers a fascinating solution to this. They do scale vertically with a higher TPS than Ethereum but they also offer a horizontal scaling solution. Polkadot was built with Substrate. Substrate is a bunch of node modules that allow you to build your own blockchain fairly fast and customize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.parity.io/substrate-has-arrived/"&gt;core substrate modules&lt;/a&gt; you are connected to Polkadot. As well, you can borrow from Polkadot’s consensus security. Thus, if I now want to build my own chain I do not have to worry about the bridge or the security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can customize and deploy a specific chain for a specific use case. We have seen this model pop up with Ethereum and some other really cool projects. For example, Burner wallet is all the rage and for good reason. It allows you to spend DAI by bridging over to the PoA network. Thus the burdens of gas are reduced astronomically. With Polkadot the creation of specific blockchains for this use purpose will have a lot of friction removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, not only does Polkadot excite me, it left me staring up at my bed unable to sleep imagining a world with as many blockchains as websites communicating with each other. After spending a few hours deploying my own demo parachain, I knew I wanted to get my hands wet with Polkadot itself, so it’s been added to our &lt;a href="https://faucets.blockxlabs.com/?utm_source=Medium&amp;amp;utm_campaign=PolkaDot"&gt;Universal Faucet&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blockchain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://poc-3.polkadot.io"&gt;Polkadot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tokens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chain: Alexander&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DOTs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why this Blockchain?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They didn’t have a faucet yet and it will be an amazing chain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love anything by &lt;a href="http://poc-3.polkadot.io"&gt;Parity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Getting coins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://matrix.to/#/!fOOzymDEHiIIUtmlBE:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&amp;amp;via=matrix.parity.io&amp;amp;via=status.im"&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; was super nice, after we demoed what we built people were tripping over themselves to send us more DOTs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sending a Transaction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This wasn’t bad at all, the &lt;a href="https://polkadot.js.org/ui/ui-identicon/#usage-examples"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; was pretty decent. I personally had an issue with some older packages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The JS &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/api"&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; are getting updated quite frequently, the blockchain is new not even mainnet so constant updates are a good thing, makes it a tad bit challenging trying to use it though&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/7eaec0170358cb483332116cc7fee411/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/7eaec0170358cb483332116cc7fee411/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Technical notes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Endpoint we were using was a websocket which was really cool.

These are some critical milestones for both the projects as well as for the investors. Once a project reaches the testnet phase, it just gives out the message that the platform will be around for a long-term and shows good development in terms of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an investor’s perspective, this gives the project more legitimacy and more confidence to invest in the project. From a token value perspective, in the past, all major mainnet launches have seen a surge in token price which ranged to a healthy 25%- 30% in the current market and even more than 100% in the good old bull market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So what’s exactly is Testnet and Mainnet?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*aWKEPLBmP3fQp_uu.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testnet and Mainnet launches are simply the first steps to show the project is making substantial progress. When a project is launched as an ICO, the native token will be launched mostly as an ERC20, NEO, XLM etc based token which will be running on the respective blockchain. Once the project has successfully tested a stable product, it the natural course to launch its own mainnet for the journey ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launching of its independent blockchain happens in two-phase. The first step is the testnet launch. As the name suggests, a &lt;strong&gt;testnet&lt;/strong&gt; is like a prototype of the proposed end product(in this case “mainnet”) for developers to experiment and test-run without risking breaking the main blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In simple terms, a Testnet is the network used to test all the functionality of the mainnet before it is launched for widescale use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the team is satisfied with the performance of testnet, all the changes are incorporated and the &lt;strong&gt;mainnet &lt;/strong&gt;is rolled out and will be made available for the public to use. Once the blockchain is deemed to be stable various exchanges and wallets start the process of token swaps and will be providing the users with the new tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Past stories: The Good and the Bad.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The EOS Mainnet nightmare&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*shlCiE6c7KGW_jinthx8Hg.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;EOS is backed by Block.one which raised &lt;a href="https://www.ccn.com/eos-ico-approaches-4-billion-after-year-long-crowdsale/"&gt;$4 billion&lt;/a&gt; for the project via an ICO that ran for almost a year. The EOS project is, we can say, reasonably young in the blockchain space which aims to radically improve on what is on the market today by bringing together positive elements of both the Bitcoin and Ethereum platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major focus EOS platform is to eventually allow for industrial-scale applications, through the elimination of transaction fees and an ability to process tens of thousands of transactions per second; in contrast, to Ethereum that can currently handle around 15 transactions per second and Bitcoin with seven transactions a second, only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EOS mainnet launch was one of the most awaited events for the year of 2018. The mainnet was scheduled to be launched on June 2018. Just a couple of days before the launch, Block.one’s email account was&lt;a href="https://ambcrypto.com/millions-worth-eos-token-stolen-from-investors-block-one-becomes-online-scam-victim/"&gt; hacked&lt;/a&gt; and hackers started to send the phishing email offering free EOS tokens. The link given in the mail was routed to an EOS styled website, asked the users to enter their private key to unlock their wallets to get the free tokens. Then you know what could have happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just around a week before the mainnet launch, Chinese internet security firm, Qihoo360 &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-report-epic-vulnerabilities-discovered-in-eos-blockchain-patched-same-day"&gt;found several vulnerabilities in the EOS network&lt;/a&gt; and they reported this to Block.one. These loopholes could have allowed hackers to remote control EOS nodes and attack any cryptocurrency built on top of its blockchain. Unsurprisingly Block.One asked Qihoo360 not to report the bugs to the public as they claimed to have resolved it on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly Block.one came up with a bug bounty program against their earlier communications of&lt;em&gt; “all is well”&lt;/em&gt;. This gave a doubt that EOS seemed to have misinformed their community about vulnerabilities getting fixed in time for the mainnet launch. This also confirmed that the testnet was not appropriately tested which ultimately lead to these kinds of issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/eosio/calling-all-devs-the-eosio-bug-bounty-program-is-live-7219c625a444"&gt;Calling all Devs: The EOSIO Bug Bounty Program is Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within 48 hrs of its launch, it was reported that EOS mainnet was &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-mainnet-experiences-freeze-two-days-after-launch"&gt;experiencing a freeze&lt;/a&gt;. Irrespective of having such massive funding and resources, these setbacks from EOS was surprising to the crypto community, and all these instances proved &lt;em&gt;how not to launch a mainnet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Aelf Testnet — Showing the way.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*PXHCyeLP6zcqVtSW.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based out of Singapore, Aelf is a decentralised platform for cloud computing blockchain network, that is trying to develop the operating system exclusively for blockchains. As per the team “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;aelf is planning to be the “Linux system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” of the Blockchain, enabling organisations to build their own systems with any consensus mechanism desired on the blockchain. It is a decentralised, self-evolving cloud computing network also capable of cross-chain interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aelf was recently in the news for initiating the &lt;strong&gt;Aelf Innovation Alliance.&lt;/strong&gt; The main aim behind the initiative is to accelerate blockchain adaptation among the enterprises. Besides Aelf other members of the Innovation Alliance includes Michael Arrington( creator of TechCrunch), Signum Capital(Singapore-based digital fund), FBG Capital (an Asian blockchain hedge fund), Roland Berger(Strategy consultancy company based out of Germany) and Huobi labs( blockchain incubation wing of Huobi). You can read more about the Innovation Alliance &lt;a href="https://medium.com/aelfblockchain/aelf-announced-the-inauguration-of-the-innovation-alliance-38c178f7a69"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*IAqv5ZQ3K5IB5hbWM10aOw.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aelf testnet was officially launched on June 30, 2018. It went on to clock an incredible achievement of 14,968 TPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/aelfblockchain/aelf-testnet-results-explained-2efd00240837"&gt;Aelf Testnet Results Explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aelf’s testnet functionalities offered were&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;💠&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Multi-node P2P communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;💠 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smart contract&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;💠 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parallel processing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;💠 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cluster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;💠 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic DPOS consensus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike EOS, Aelf went ahead and made all codes are available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/AElfProject/AElf/wiki"&gt;GitHub &lt;/a&gt;and created a guide to welcome all developers to recreate and improve the testnet. With the support of this documentation, a developer can learn and apply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to build a local test environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to write a contract, publish a contract, execute a contract;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Test data executed in parallel operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the mainnet launch, the team has planned to implement cross-chain interaction, complete the network economic system, peripheral tools and improve the developer system as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also was keeping the community posted about its progress via its weekly reports on development progress updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/aelfblockchain/development-progress-update-mar-17th-55b96f3a953b"&gt;Development Progress Update (Mar 17th)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike EOS which created a bounty once the flaw was discovered, Aelf went ahead with a developer bounty to improve the testnet and upcoming mainnet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these were done as part of the collective initiative to pool in more brains and make the testnet foolproof. Aelf has made it quite clear on various occasions that they have followed closely the mainnet launches of projects like EOS, learned where it went wrong and have improved on the launch process to reduce the errors and issues that these projects have suffered. All these are done keeping in mind that they will be having a successful launch and the mainnet will be able to fully support large-scale commercial use helping adaptation of blockchain at an enterprise level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving a project from a whitepaper to having its own blockchain is no small feat. Since we are in the earlier stage of crypto, these kinds of small setback are bound to happen. What matters is how the new and upcoming projects learn from these setbacks and iterate their process to have a smooth and successful product launch in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I am a community member of Aelf and am passionate about the blockchain. I will not receive any payments for the same as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Always keep in mind that trading digital assets involves significant risk and can result in the loss of your invested capital. You should take into consideration your level of experience, investment objectives and seek independent financial advice if necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f857a82b91ad" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-launch-or-not-launch-a-mainnet-testnet-f857a82b91ad"&gt;How to Launch (or not launch) a Mainnet/Testnet?&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2019 18:32:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cointelegraph: Coinbase Reveals Hot Wallet Coverage Up to $225 Mln Via Lloyd’s of London Broker -

&lt;div&gt;Why did Bitcoin (BTC) rise 20% in value in half an hour is anyone’s guess. But it did today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTC skidded through three key resistance levels at $4,200, $4,420 and  $4,567 on the way to $5000+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;many analysts predict could go to as high as $5,500 in the upcoming days, according to CCN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the FOMO people rush to buy before BTC rises to $10k?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bitcoin market and crypto market, in general, continues to be small relative to the rest of the markets -- and emotional,” Jehan Chu, managing partner at blockchain investment and advisory firm Kenetic Capital told Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s still very much subject to waves of enthusiasm. I don’t think today is anything special, other than a temporary enthusiasm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say hello to BTC @ $5000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hovering around $4,000 for days (even perhaps months), BTC reached a high of $5,106 on Bitfinex – a new all-time high for 2019, according to the Dailyhodl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading volume has also skyrocketed for BTC, up 125% from $289.5 to $655.2 million on the Real 10 Volumes index over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 3 months, BTC swung between $3,217 and $4,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is trading at over $150, up 6.06%. XRP is trading at $0.3323, up 6.77%. Litecoin is trading at $67.42, up 11.17%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto hedge fund Tetras Capital outlined bullish reasons why the crypto marketing is suddenly on the move, including ongoing US quantitative easing, baby boomers retiring, the upcoming US election and the Bitcoin halving set to happen in May of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundstrat co-founder and head of research Tom Lee said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“... definitely a number of macro factors acting as tailwinds for BTC. Several of which were headwinds in 2018.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Fundstrat, Bloomberg, Coinmarketcap, BitMEX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudden jump&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of BTC shot up 17% within 30 minutes on Tuesday,  reports Coindesk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bitcoin’s market capitalization has also risen significantly, up $5.1 billion on the day to $78.8 billion, its highest since Nov. 22, 2018,” said Coindesk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bitcoin price recorded a massive surge from $4,200 to nearly $4,800 within minutes, demonstrating a 20% gain in a short time frame, according to CCN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Earlier this week, economist and global markets analyst Alex Krüger said that a price movement of bitcoin above the $4,200 level will mark the end of the bear trend beginning January 2018, lasting 16 months,” said CCN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTC wait &amp;amp; see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTC has lead a surge in virtual currencies and ended 3 months of calm in the $160 billion market, according to Bloomberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Traders struggled to pinpoint a reason for the rally, which briefly lifted Bitcoin above $5,000 and increased the value of digital assets tracked by CoinMarketCap.com by about $17 billion in less than an hour, says Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While sudden swings in Bitcoin are nothing new, price action in the virtual currency has been relatively subdued this year as investors weighed the prospects for more mainstream adoption after last year’s 74% crash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big buy or sell orders in Bitcoin can often lead to outsized moves while trend-following individual investors can also exacerbate volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s FOMO vs WNC (wait &amp;amp; see). Which side are you on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We’re recording the shares on this giant excel spreadsheet in the sky we call Ethereum, or Blockchain. But it’s got these great properties, which is that it’s public, so you know that if this smart contract represents shares, there’s no double counting of shares. And, you no longer have to go to the company to record the transfer of the shares. Buyer and seller can find each other digitally, they can transact digitally on the Blockchain, and in essence both of them are writing a new entry to the books of records in the company and they’re both signing it digitally.&lt;em&gt;” — Josh Stein&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-kabhy-acc685"&gt;Tokenized Equity with Josh Stein from Harbor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Production and music by Derek Bernard — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://haberdasherband.com/production?fbclid=IwAR2d8t0cNGHRm1ajmUNWKZ-TMUMawREhvIHSy54LKcOElf7v_TOvkAjZ78Y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;haberdasherband.com/production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Host: Trent Lapinski — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://trentlapinski.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://trentlapinski.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S.

                &lt;br&gt;Since the start of 2018, Mexico’s financial regulators have adopted a progressive approach towards financial inclusion and policymakers are looking at FinTech startups &amp;amp;amp; banks to help them. In January 2019, Mexico unveiled new measures to boost financial inclusion and promote new payments platforms for mobile devices. In 2018 alone, over 130 FinTechs were founded in Mexico. Overall, Payments &amp;amp;amp; Remittances, Lending, and Enterprise Financial Management are the hottest segments in terms of the number of startups. Here is a list of 10 well-funded FinTech startups in Mexico: PayClip was founded in 2012 and has raised $42.3 million in total funding. PayClip enables merchants to accept payments on their smartphone or tablet using the Clip card reader. The company offers a portable card reader that fits into the headphone socket of smartphones and tablets. PayClip was formerly known as BlitzPay, Inc.

&lt;div&gt;A UAE survey by Citrix shines a light on the optimism of local workforce has when it comes to AI and robotics in the workplace, with 45% indicating a positive outcome within the next 5 years and 55% indicating both positive and negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about the biggest benefit of AI within the workplace, 47% said it will help them perform very complex tasks, while nearly 35% of workers said AI and robotics will help them become free from the most repetitive tasks, while&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is evident that the UAE workforce believes the outlook of AI and robotics within the workplace is a positive one. This is a green light for technology companies to continue to adapt and evolve our solutions that will aid in this transformation,” said Ali Kaddoura, UAE Country Manager at Citrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the UAE, Dubai and the youngest generation of workers showed more enthusiasm when it comes to the positive impact of integrating AI and robot at the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence is also a source of concern with 50% of the respondents fearing its propagation will lead to a loss of jobs. Despite this worry, a mere 2.8% of workers said AI and robots will negatively affect their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, AI is not seen as a panacea. While nearly 30% of knowledge workers wish to be equipped with superhuman intelligence as a superpower, they primarily wish for developing their creativity at work. This is the number one skill (44%) respondents would like to acquire within the next five years and the number one soft skill companies need the most in 2019 according to LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rise of AI and robotics in the workplace will allow creativity to become increasingly important as it is precisely one of the skills machines can’t automate. The Citrix survey makes clear that UAE workers are as excited as we are for the emerging use of AI and robotics within the workplace. As the workplace becomes more and more intelligent, people and organizations can unlock innovation, engage customers, and be productive. Citrix is here to help develop the technology workers need to drive business forward,” said Kaddoura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Citrix survey, carried about by Onepoll, includes responses from over 500 working professionals across all seven emirates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I felt that sweet glumness of simultaneously being happy the market was turning &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; wishing I’d bought more Bitcoin during the doldrums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily for my dependents, I know nothing about &lt;em&gt;trading&lt;/em&gt; except that I’m far too emotional for it. So — rather than late night FOMO-buying — I scrolled through a sufficient number of OMG-gifs on twitter, then went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;By morning, the dust had (semi) settled...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been a giant price-spike, followed by a slight retreat as opportunistic sellers collected gains, and a (temporarily) reset price about 14% higher than the same time yesterday. More importantly, the new plateau represented a dramatic shift from the smallish, inconclusive price moves Bitcoin has seen over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with this big one-hour jump, I had the opportunity to scratch a curiosity-itch that has been with me for a while: &lt;strong&gt;How does the liquidity of Bitcoin’s market affect its price?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words — and there is probably more market-savvy terminology to express this idea — how much of Bitcoin’s price movement is a function of the number of people willing to buy or sell it, rather than &lt;em&gt;long-term-hodl*&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8rZtRJanhOTGkn7DESeXaQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Bitcoin term “&lt;strong&gt;hodl&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is said by some to stand for “&lt;strong&gt;h&lt;/strong&gt;old &lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;n for &lt;strong&gt;d&lt;/strong&gt;ear &lt;strong&gt;l&lt;/strong&gt;ife” — which is incorrect. It was actually a drunken typo. By the Roman playwright Tacitus. But I digress. But regardless of &lt;em&gt;hodl&lt;/em&gt;’s origins, it expresses a common sentiment among hardcore Bitcoiners: Except in dire circumstances (war, famine, poker losses), one simply does not sell.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s overall market capitalization was, prior to yesterday’s spike, around $71 billion USD. Now that’s up to $83 billion and change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is famously ruled by supply and demand — even more so than other commodities—because it has a fixed, scheduled, merciless supply schedule. Eventually this will culminate in 21 million bitcoins; today it is about 17.6 million, ticking up block-by-block. (The way this works is fascinating, but &lt;a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Emission"&gt;it’s well-explained elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; and I won’t do so here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Let’s do some napkin-math.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the hour where this action took place, five or so “blocks” were added to the Bitcoin blockchain, so 62.5 new bitcoins entered the world. Against a 17-million supply, that’s inconsequential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price rise — equating to $12 billion in market cap — took place because of the sale of existing bitcoins. (I know, “duh,” right? But stay with me.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How many&lt;/em&gt; bitcoins had to sell in order to drive up the price like this? According to BCB Group’s Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/02/reuters-america-update-3-bitcoin-jumps-20-percent-mystery-order-seen-as-catalyst.html"&gt;quoted here by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;), the impetus was three 7,000-bitcoin buy orders spread across three trading exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this mass purchase are subject to speculation, but many suspect a “short squeeze” — a big trader who had previously been betting &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; Bitcoin changing his mind and buying the requisite coin to “cover” his financial exposure. Without enough willing sellers, he this anonymous buyer was forced to bid up prices in order to close out his “short” position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in any market, when you need to buy a lot of something in a hurry, people notice…and it’s tempting to give you a crappy deal. In the amoral world of currency trading, such temptations always win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that von Landsberg-Sadie’s numbers are correct and it was 21,000 bitcoins purchased that drove BTC’s price from $4,170 to $4,885.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implies “only” $95 million of purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think — how weird is that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;$95 million of &lt;em&gt;money actually spent &lt;/em&gt;equated to $12 billion in &lt;em&gt;perceived increase in market value&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you, like me, don’t work in finance, this sort of thing makes you pause, blink, check your numbers, blink again, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because those numbers show 125x leverage on &lt;em&gt;what actually happened&lt;/em&gt; compared to what &lt;em&gt;seems to have happened&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market, over the course of an hour, got $0.034 greedier &lt;em&gt;per bitcoin sold &lt;/em&gt;as this big buyer revealed his intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This price jump was possible only because of the “thin liquidity” of the Bitcoin market. There are currently 17.6 million bitcoin in the world. It’s been estimated that 3–4 million of them are lost forever, due to early users who weren’t careful with their digital wallets’ “keys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means, in practice, there are only 14 million bitcoin available to buy today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; means that this whale-sized buyer, with a 21,000 BTC appetite, was trying to buy up 0.15% of &lt;em&gt;all the bitcoin in existence.&lt;/em&gt; In one hour.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s cool that this is even possible. In no other commodity, ever, has this been technically feasible. If some Chinese emperor had wanted to buy up 0.15% of the world’s rice supply — despite having the money and the soldiers to do so — he couldn’t make that decision, negotiate a price, take physical custody, and be assured he’d succeeded, inside of an hour. The technology just wasn’t there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about a financial market’s liquidity for a sec. Bitcoin’s price went up because there were willing sellers — and these sellers realized they could charge a premium and get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most people who own Bitcoin don’t keep their digital assets stored on the exchanges where the buying happened. The actual &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; available for this whale to buy from was only a small subset: &lt;strong&gt;A x B x C&lt;/strong&gt;, where…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A =&lt;/strong&gt; number of people who own Bitcoin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B =&lt;/strong&gt; percent of &lt;strong&gt;A &lt;/strong&gt;who were keeping their Bitcoin on trading exchanges during the hour when the whale got hungry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C = &lt;/strong&gt;percent of &lt;strong&gt;B &lt;/strong&gt;who had established prices at which they’d sell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many such people were there, and how many bitcoin did they represent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t know those answers — except that there were at least 21,000 BTC they could pony up, and that the incremental cost of getting them to do so was 3.4 cents &lt;em&gt;over the previous market price&lt;/em&gt; for each and every BTC&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Let’s extrapolate.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is loose, back-of-the-napkin math, but the point is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night’s price move implies that if a whale entered the Bitcoin market &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; looking to buy 445,000 BTC —an amount which is only 2.5% of the world’s final, circulating supply* — &lt;strong&gt;this would drive up Bitcoin’s price past its $20,000 all-time high&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;* Current coins, minus presumed-lost coins, plus all future to-be-mined coins.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, back to reality: no one will be surprised if over the next few days, some bitcoin owners take profits from this sudden price-jump, and Bitcoin’s market cap sinks back down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the larger lesson should give us pause for reflection…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If some vastly wealthy entity — a nation-state, a sovereign wealth fund, etc.— decides that the market is undervaluing a &lt;em&gt;provably scarce, un-inflatable, digitally-deliverable &lt;/em&gt;commodity, and wants to buy up a mere 2.5% of the global Bitcoin supply…today’s price quadruples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then consider: what happens when &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; rich entity FOMOs and decides to buy up &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; one percent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=61b541dcc2bb" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-hidden-implications-of-bitcoins-overnight-price-jump-61b541dcc2bb"&gt;The Hidden Implications of Bitcoin’s Overnight Price-Jump&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2019 22:59:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hackernoon: Delivering Practical Privacy in Blockchain and DLT Applications -  Puntaje: 49700</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/delivering-practical-privacy-in-blockchain-and-dlt-applications-e4fbca82327b?source=rss----3a8144eabfe3---4</link><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vlelUcILZ4Vr8ZAXNzdEMw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getreferd.com/blog/how-blockchain-can-change-healthcare/"&gt;https://www.getreferd.com/blog/how-blockchain-can-change-healthcare/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of crypto, privacy was a critical focus in blockchain development but difficult for the average user to achieve. From 2011–2014, creating &lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature"&gt;multi-signature transactions&lt;/a&gt; was considered a cutting-edge technique that provided advanced users more privacy and security than executing standard peer-to-peer transactions alone. Now multisig is standard and more user friendly than ever. So, what’s changed in the last 5 years? And when can we expect blockchains to deliver practical privacy for non-technical users and businesses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New Privacy-Preserving Protocols&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin executes &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymity"&gt;pseudo-anonymous&lt;/a&gt; transactions, meaning that transaction records are slightly obfuscated but can be figured out by analyzing the public blockchain ledger. While early onlookers of Bitcoin heralded it for anonymous transactions, this was never really the case. When all transactions are public and immutable, time will tell all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this means for businesses is that Bitcoin is currently impractical from a privacy perspective but there’s hope at the end of the tunnel. Fortunately, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals like &lt;a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0156.mediawiki"&gt;BIP 56&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki"&gt;Schnorr BIP &lt;/a&gt;are being developed to increase privacy and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wAatL5K8v97jq23awKVWIA.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/cryptoadvance/how-schnorr-signatures-may-improve-bitcoin-91655bcb4744"&gt;https://medium.com/cryptoadvance/how-schnorr-signatures-may-improve-bitcoin-91655bcb4744&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIP 56 implements individual anonymity guarantees using the new &lt;a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/anatomy-anonymity-how-dandelion-could-make-bitcoin-more-private/"&gt;Dandelion protocol&lt;/a&gt;. Like a dandelion floats aimlessly through the air before randomly spreading its seeds, the Dandelion protocol follows a similar function, hiding where and when a transaction originated from before broadcasting the transaction publicly. Rolling out BIP 56 as a soft fork would improve Bitcoin privacy guarantees and permit other privacy and scalability BIPs like &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@SDWouters/why-schnorr-signatures-will-help-solve-2-of-bitcoins-biggest-problems-today-9b7718e7861c"&gt;Schnorr signatures&lt;/a&gt; to complement the improvement at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnorr signatures are shorter than &lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm"&gt;ECDSA signatures&lt;/a&gt; found in Bitcoin and Ethereum, saving space in each block added to the blockchain and solving practical business needs like scalability. What’s more, Schnorr signatures can perform multi-signature transactions much more efficiently than ECDSA. In Schnorr multisig, &lt;em&gt;m-of-n&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;signatures can be consolidated into one round of signing&lt;/em&gt;, instead of requiring each private key holder to sign the public key over multiple rounds. This means that it takes less time to execute each multisig transaction because there are fewer public keys to sign and transactions records are more opaque due to the nature of key consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping financial transactions private is essential to businesses in many industries and verticals because financial records can reveal company status, progress, and intent. If your competitors can see what you’re purchasing and investing in, they have a competitive advantage over you. As Bitcoin improvements like the Dandelion protocol and Schnorr signatures go live, businesses will benefit from private transactions that scale more efficiently than public transactions today. And other cryptocurrencies are following suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blockchain Privacy Cuts Both Ways&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privacy appeals to parties at both ends of the spectrum. For instance, cypherpunks are interested in privacy for the sake of online independence and self-sovereignty. And businesses are interested in anonymizing protocols for the purpose of keeping business transactions private. This is particularly true for the highly transactional private sector where poor security can lead to exposed user privacy and sensitive, personally identifying information (PII) like in the case of &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2018/12/10/equifax-hack-lasted-for-76-days-compromised-148-million-people-government-report-says/"&gt;Equifax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/03/technology/business/yahoo-breach-3-billion-accounts/index.html"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;, or more recently, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/garystoller/2018/12/03/freeze-your-credit-now-after-marriottstarwood-hacking-expert-says/#e1f966c32b3f"&gt;Marriott / Starwood Hotels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/712/1*MwkeFVEUwq-tP1e0APqWWg.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/blockchain-proves-its-worth-healthcare-regulatory-questions-remain"&gt;https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/blockchain-proves-its-worth-healthcare-regulatory-questions-remain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This broad spectrum of users and use cases makes privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications a center for continued development. Privacy-preserving protocols like &lt;a href="https://medium.com/digitalassetresearch/schnorr-signatures-the-inevitability-of-privacy-in-bitcoin-b2f45a1f7287?ref=tokendaily"&gt;Schnorr signatures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/"&gt;zkSNARKS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/beam-mw/mimblewimble-explained-like-youre-12-d779a5bb483d"&gt;MimbleWimble&lt;/a&gt; that obfuscate and anonymize transactions by design are being explored in various capacities. I believe we’ll continue to see the advancement of privacy-enhancing blockchain solutions in the short- to long-term future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An emerging consideration for businesses developing privacy coins is their approach to developing open source vs. permissioned protocols. For instance, the MimbleWimble protocol, which uses ECC primitives to fully anonymize transactions, is being developed by both open source communities (seen in the &lt;a href="https://grin-tech.org/"&gt;Grin&lt;/a&gt; implementation), and private companies, like Israeli startup, &lt;a href="https://www.beam.mw/"&gt;Beam&lt;/a&gt;, which is trying to blend regulatory considerations and business best practices in a more controlled manner. Beam is implementing permissioned, confidential transactions that can be selectively audited by a 3rd party and has intentions to open source their code at a future date. Appealing to both cypherpunks and regulated businesses can be a risky business proposition. But in the world of crypto, experimentation leads the way. And, so far, both Grin and Beam are finding early success with their privacy coins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Striking a Regulatory Balance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achieving a balance between anonymity and regulatory compliance will take the focus of blockchain projects in the next few years. As regulations and copyright directives like &lt;a href="https://eugdpr.org/"&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18283541/european-union-copyright-directive-internet-article-13"&gt;Article 13&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.law.com/njlawjournal/2018/12/01/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-what-you-need-to-know/?slreturn=20190215105417"&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act &lt;/a&gt;continue to roll out worldwide, cryptocurrencies that focus on compliance will fare well in practice, while those which try to deliver fully anonymous, open source solutions will find their niche outside the scope of regulated business practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, we saw JPMorgan release its own B2B &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin"&gt;stablecoin&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments"&gt;JPM Coin&lt;/a&gt; focused on remittances. JPM Coin uses a private ledger based on its own permissioned implementation of enterprise Ethereum, &lt;a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum"&gt;Quorum&lt;/a&gt;, which restricts access to compliant businesses by design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vULJIDXxnNuDqryDeUSlsA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.investinblockchain.com/blockchain-digital-privacy-future/"&gt;https://www.investinblockchain.com/blockchain-digital-privacy-future/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strategy of developing a crypto-asset using a private distributed ledger technology (DLT) sidesteps a lot of technical hurdles that need to be overcome by public &amp;amp; open source cryptocurrencies. However, JPM Coin does not play nice with other banks, financial institutions, or startups developing their own crypto-assets. At least, yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sandbox limits the scope and utility of JPM Coin for clients. When client needs change and businesses evolve in new directions, clients using JPM Coin and consortium-based cryptocurrencies will be left shortchanged. The on-boarding costs for special-purpose DLTs are low and can solve niche use cases in the short-term but the costs to change tack towards a more interoperable, public blockchain infrastructure in the future could be prohibitive. Forward-looking firms should take time to weigh their options wisely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Privacy-as-a-Service Timeline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short-term, bank and consortium-based cryptocurrencies will fulfil very specific needs like inter-bank SWIFT transactions, which can reduce the intensive margins of costly international payments and remittances. This first wave will be executed using proprietary, niche technologies that are designed to meet big business realities like regulatory and consumer protection compliance at the cost of minimal interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-term, private cryptocurrencies like Beam will catch up in order to fulfil compliance considerations like AML &amp;amp; KYC as well as provide opt-in audit trails for otherwise confidential transactions. This tactic will appeal to smaller businesses that can’t afford the overhead cost or exclusivity requirements of large enterprises like JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UpA4TOWdr54dXI78GrLFJw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082914/basics-buying-and-investing-bitcoin.asp"&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082914/basics-buying-and-investing-bitcoin.asp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both the short- and the long-term timelines, cypherpunk-endorsed privacy coins like Grin and &lt;a href="https://z.cash/"&gt;Zcash&lt;/a&gt; will appeal to individuals in countries like Venezuela where self-sovereignty and anonymity are critical considerations to using cryptocurrency over local fiat currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more industries and verticals like travel &amp;amp; hospitality, supply chain management, and IoT are attracted to the benefits of blockchain and distributed ledger technology, I believe we will see privacy being developed as a core component of future applications in the next 3–5 years. Once privacy, scalability, and interoperability are solved for in the private sector, public blockchain technology will begin to serve as the new &lt;em&gt;modus operandi&lt;/em&gt; for a new, decentralized business architecture and make a world-wide impact in the next 5–10 years. Slowly but surely, the building blocks for a private and secure decentralized future are stacking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e4fbca82327b" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/delivering-practical-privacy-in-blockchain-and-dlt-applications-e4fbca82327b"&gt;Delivering Practical Privacy in Blockchain and DLT Applications&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com"&gt;Hacker Noon&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2019 19:36:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
